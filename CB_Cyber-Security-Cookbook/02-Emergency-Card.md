# Emergency Card

## Summary

<!-- TODO -->

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** In a stress situation every minute counts — employees must immediately know what to do and whom to contact. Without easily accessible emergency information, the response to information security incidents is delayed.

This emergency card provides a concise overview of immediate actions during an information security incident, contact details for key personnel, and the most common incident types. It is designed to be printed and displayed at the workplace.

The emergency card complements the incident management process (CB_PRC_01) as a quick reference. It is distributed during onboarding (CB_AWR_02) and referenced in awareness training (CB_AWR_01).

**Scope:** All employees. Quick reference for information security incidents at the workplace.
