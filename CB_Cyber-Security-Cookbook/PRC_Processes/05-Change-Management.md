# Change Management Process

## Summary

<!-- TODO -->

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** Uncontrolled changes to IT systems and applications are a common cause of outages and security vulnerabilities. Without a defined process, impact analysis, approval, and rollback capability are absent.

This process defines the workflow from change request through impact analysis and approval to implementation and rollback. It ensures that changes are traceable, approved, and reversible.

The process operationalizes the requirements from CB_POL_L2_04-Secure-Development (change management section). Changes are documented and, where necessary, escalated to the risk assessment (CB_PRC_07).

**Scope:** All changes to production IT systems and applications within the ISMS scope. Triggers: change request from a business unit, IT operations, or a security requirement.
