# Internal Audit Process

## Summary

<!-- TODO -->

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** Internal audits are the primary mechanism for independent verification of the ISMS. Without a defined audit process, systematic examination of whether requirements are met and controls effectively implemented is absent.

This process defines the workflow from audit programme planning through individual audit preparation, execution, and reporting to the follow-up of findings. It ensures that all ISMS aspects are reviewed at least once within a two-year period.

The process operationalizes the requirements from HB_CLS_9.2 (Internal Audit). Findings are recorded as nonconformities in HB_REG_05 and tracked via CB_PRC_10.

**Scope:** All ISMS aspects within a two-year cycle. Triggers: annual audit programme planning or extraordinary events.
