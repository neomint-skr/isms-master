# Performance Monitoring Process

## Summary

<!-- TODO -->

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** The effectiveness of controls and ISMS processes cannot be demonstrated without systematic measurement. Without a defined process, improvement decisions are based on assumptions rather than evidence.

This process defines the workflow from KPI definition and measurement methods through data collection and analysis to reporting and escalation upon target deviation. It ensures that trends are identifiable and progress is verifiable.

The process operationalizes the requirements from HB_CLS_9.1 (Monitoring and Measurement) and HB_CLS_6.2 (IS Objectives). Measurement results feed into the management review (CB_PRC_09) as input.

**Scope:** IS processes, controls, and IS objectives (HB_REG_01). Triggers: scheduled measurement cycle or extraordinary information needs.

## KPI definition and measurement methods

<!-- TODO: Reference to CLS_9.1 (framework) and CLS_6.2 (IS objectives) -->

## Data collection

<!-- TODO: Responsible persons, sources, frequency -->

## Analysis and reporting

<!-- TODO: Analysis, trends, report format, recipients -->

## Escalation

<!-- TODO: Thresholds, escalation path upon target deviation -->
