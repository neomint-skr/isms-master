# Nonconformity Management Process

## Summary

<!-- TODO -->

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** Nonconformities arising from audits, incidents, or monitoring require systematic treatment. Without a defined process, root causes remain unidentified, corrective actions uncontrolled, and effectiveness unverified.

This process defines the workflow from detection and reporting through root cause analysis and corrective actions to effectiveness review. It ensures that identified deviations are systematically addressed and their resolution is demonstrated.

The process operationalizes the requirements from HB_CLS_10.2 (Nonconformity and Corrective Action). Findings are documented in HB_REG_05 (Nonconformity Register) and tracked to completion.

**Scope:** All nonconformities within the ISMS scope. Triggers: audit findings (CB_PRC_08), security incidents (CB_PRC_01), monitoring deviations (CB_PRC_11), or external reports.

## Detection and reporting

<!-- TODO: Sources (audit, monitoring, incident), reporting path -->

## Analysis and root cause evaluation

<!-- TODO: Root cause analysis, impact assessment -->

## Corrective actions

<!-- TODO: Definition, responsible persons, deadlines -->

## Effectiveness review

<!-- TODO: Verification of actions, timeframe -->
