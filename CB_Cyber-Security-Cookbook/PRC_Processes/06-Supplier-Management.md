# Supplier Management Process

## Summary

<!-- TODO -->

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** Suppliers and cloud providers process information outside the organization's direct control. Without a defined process for assessment, contract design, and monitoring, third-party risk remains unmanaged.

This process defines the workflow from supplier assessment through contractual security requirements to ongoing monitoring. It ensures that IS requirements are consistently addressed in supplier relationships.

The process operationalizes the requirements from CB_POL_L2_05-Suppliers-and-Cloud. Assessment results are documented in HB_REG_04 (Supplier Register) and reviewed regularly.

**Scope:** All external service providers and cloud providers that process information within the ISMS scope. Triggers: new supplier relationship, contract amendment, or annual review.

## Assessment

Assessment results are documented in HB_REG_04-Supplier-Register.
