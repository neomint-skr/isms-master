# Onboarding Checklist

## Summary

<!-- TODO -->

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** New employees must be familiar with the IS rules from day one and confirm their acknowledgement. Without a structured onboarding process, knowledge gaps arise that can lead to avoidable security incidents in the first weeks.

This checklist defines the IS-relevant onboarding steps — from guideline acknowledgement and access provisioning to awareness training. It ensures that no step is missed and that acknowledgement is documented.

The checklist is used by HR managers and the ISMS Coordinator during the onboarding process (CB_POL_L2_10, employment contract section). The awareness content is drawn from CB_AWR_01.

**Scope:** All new employees and external personnel at onboarding. Target audience: HR managers (execution), new employees (recipients).
