# Awareness Fundamentals

## Summary

<!-- TODO -->

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** Technical controls are only effective when employees can recognise the most common threats and respond appropriately. Without a fundamental security awareness, phishing, weak passwords, and delayed incident reporting become the greatest risk factor.

This document conveys the essential IS fundamentals — top risks, phishing recognition, password hygiene, and correct incident reporting. It forms the content foundation for the awareness programme of [Organization].

The contents support the requirements from CB_POL_L2_10 (Human Resources, awareness section). They are delivered through regular training sessions and communicated to new employees via CB_AWR_02 (Onboarding).

**Scope:** All employees and external personnel. Foundational training at onboarding, annual refresher.

## Awareness Programme

The awareness programme of the organization shall cover the following aspects (addresses A.6.3):

1. **Top management commitment to IS:** Communicating the importance of effective IS management by top management
2. **Compliance:** Familiarity with applicable regulations and obligations in the area of IS and their observance
3. **Personal accountability:** Responsibility for one's own actions and omissions and general responsibility for safeguarding information
4. **Fundamental procedures:** Basic IS controls (password hygiene, phishing recognition, clear desk, incident reporting)
5. **Points of contact:** Resources for additional information and guidance on IS matters

Awareness activities are delivered through physical or virtual channels: campaigns, newsletters, briefings, e-learning modules, emails.

## Top Risks

The organization faces daily risks that may compromise confidentiality, availability, or integrity of information. The most common security events (addresses A.6.3, A.6.8):

| Event type | Description |
|---|---|
| **Phishing attacks** | Attempt to obtain sensitive information such as passwords or financial data through forged emails, websites, or messages |
| **Ransomware attacks** | Malware is installed that encrypts data or locks systems. Attackers demand ransom for release |
| **Data leaks** | Confidential information is inadvertently disclosed or stolen due to errors or vulnerabilities |
| **Insider threats** | Individuals within the organization with access to sensitive information misuse or disclose information — intentionally or unintentionally |
| **DDoS attacks** | Servers or networks are overwhelmed with a flood of internet traffic, causing them to become unavailable |
| **Digital or physical access violations** | Use of access by unauthorized persons — digital (e.g., shared passwords) or physical (e.g., unauthorized open door) |

**Reporting obligation:** Report suspicious activities immediately through the defined reporting channels without opening attachments or clicking links.
