# Frequently Asked Questions on Information Security

## Summary

<!-- TODO -->

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** Recurring questions on information security consume advisory capacity unnecessarily. Without a central point of reference for common questions, employees search at length or act on incorrect assumptions.

This FAQ answers the most frequent IS questions encountered in day-to-day work — from remote working rules and personal devices to incident reporting. It relieves the Chief Information Security Officer and ensures consistent, accurate answers.

The FAQ forms part of the awareness programme and is provided as a complement to CB_01 (Getting Started) and CB_AWR_01 (Awareness Fundamentals). New questions are added on an as-needed basis.

**Scope:** All employees. Self-service reference for everyday IS questions.

<!-- TODO: Flat Q&A list, no categories. Typical questions:
- Do I have to read all of this?
- What happens if I report an incident?
- Does this apply when working remotely?
- May I use my personal device?
- Who is the ISO and what do they do?
- Where do I report what?
-->
