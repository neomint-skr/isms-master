# Getting Started

## Summary

<!-- TODO -->

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** Employees need a quick entry point into the information security documentation. Without orientation, it remains unclear why the Cookbook exists, how it is structured, and what is expected of each individual.

This getting-started page explains the purpose of the Cyber Security Cookbook, describes its structure, and highlights the most important starting points. It answers the question "Where do I begin?" in under two minutes.

The page is the recommended starting point for all employees and links to CB_AWR_01 (Awareness), CB_Emergency-Card (Emergency Card) and CB_FAQ (FAQ) as next steps.

**Scope:** All employees and external personnel. Entry document for the Cyber Security Cookbook.
