# Acceptable Use of Generative AI Policy

## Summary

Generative AI tools can increase productivity and efficiency, yet carry risks for data protection, information security, and legal compliance when used improperly. This policy defines binding rules for the use of GenAI tools so that employees can use them responsibly and in the interest of the organization. It does not address a dedicated Annex A control but supplements the ISMS with a practice-relevant measure.

## Objective and Scope

**Guideline reference:** P1, P2
**Operationalized by:** CB_AWR_01-Awareness-Fundamentals

**Objective:** Generative AI tools are increasingly used in daily work. Without clear rules, there is a risk that confidential information is disclosed to third-party providers, outputs are adopted without review, or unapproved tools are used.

This policy establishes requirements for the permissible and prohibited use of GenAI tools. It ensures that GenAI tools are used ethically, legally, and in accordance with internal policies and provider terms of use.

GenAI tools include applications that generate text, images, code, or other content based on inputs (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot).

**Scope:** All employees, contractors, and external service providers. Covers the use of third-party GenAI tools for business purposes.

## Approval and Setup

### Approval of GenAI Tools

Employees may only use approved GenAI tools. Unapproved tools must not be used for business purposes without explicit prior authorization. [List of approved tools is maintained by the Information Security Officer.]

### Setup Rules

|---|---|
| Software installation | No downloading or installing unapproved software on organization devices |
| Account usage | Do not use business accounts for personal purposes |
| Account setup | Use business email address and contact details |

| 3 | Do not enter customer or partner information of any kind |
| 4 | Do not enter confidential or sensitive organizational information |

## Use of Outputs

GenAI tools can produce inaccurate, biased, or legally problematic content. The following rules apply:

| # | Requirement |
|---|---|
| 1 | Do not use outputs where there are concerns regarding data protection, accuracy, or intellectual property |
| 2 | Do not use outputs as a basis for important decisions about individuals (e.g., hiring) |
| 3 | Do not present unedited GenAI outputs as one's own work |
