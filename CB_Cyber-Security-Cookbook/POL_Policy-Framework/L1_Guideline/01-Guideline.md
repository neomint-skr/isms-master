# Information Security Guideline

## Summary

<!-- TODO -->

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** Information constitutes a business-critical asset of [Organization]. Without a strategic commitment by top management to information security, the foundation for all further controls and the ISMS is missing.

This guideline defines six principles (P1-P6) that serve as the strategic framework for all IS decisions. It articulates top management commitment and establishes the three-tier policy framework (L1>L2>L3).

The principles are translated into normative requirements through eleven L2 policies and operationalized into concrete instructions through seven L3 handbooks. The allocation matrix ensures traceability from the strategic level down to operational implementation.

**Scope:** The entire organization of [Organization] — all employees, management, external personnel, and business processes within the ISMS scope.

## Management Commitment

Top management commits to establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving the ISMS. This commitment is demonstrated through:

1. **Strategic alignment:** Ensuring that the IS guideline and IS objectives are consistent with the strategic objectives of the organization
2. **Integration:** Embedding IS requirements into all business processes
3. **Resource allocation:** Providing financial, technical, and human resources for the ISMS
4. **Communication:** Promoting the importance of effective IS management and ensuring that all employees understand and comply with ISMS requirements
5. **Effectiveness review:** Regularly reviewing the ISMS to ensure it achieves its objectives
6. **Support and leadership:** Encouraging and training all employees to contribute to the effectiveness of the ISMS
7. **Continual improvement:** Promoting initiatives to improve IS practices

Top management enables other management functions to demonstrate their leadership within their respective areas of responsibility.

## Principles

**P1 — Protection:** [Organization] ensures confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all information assets. Controls are aligned with the criticality of the respective information.

**P2 — Compliance:** Legal, contractual, and normative information security requirements are systematically identified and fulfilled.

**P3 — Risk orientation:** Security decisions are based on systematic risk assessment. Resources are allocated where the risk is greatest.

**P4 — Awareness:** Every employee knows their role in information security and acts accordingly. Training and awareness are an integral part of daily work.

**P5 — Continual improvement:** The ISMS is continually enhanced through the PDCA cycle. Incidents, audits, and KPIs drive improvements.

**P6 — Business continuity:** Critical business processes remain operational even during disruptions and emergencies. Preparedness and recovery measures are established.

## Policy Framework

This guideline (L1) forms the top tier of the policy framework of [Organization]. The principles are cascaded through three tiers into the organization:

| Tier | Character | Key question |
|---|---|---|
| L1 — Guideline | Strategic | WHY is information security important? |
| L2 — Policies | Normative | WHAT must be done to implement the principles? |
| L3 — Handbooks | Operational | HOW do different employee groups implement the policies in daily work? |

Each L2 policy serves at least one principle. Each L3 handbook operationalizes at least one L2 policy. This ensures that every operational requirement is traceable back to a strategic rationale.
