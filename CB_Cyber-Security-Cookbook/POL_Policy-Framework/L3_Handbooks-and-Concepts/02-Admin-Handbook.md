# Administration Handbook

## Summary

<!-- TODO -->

## Objective and Scope

**Standard reference:** CB_POL_L2_01-Access-and-Identity, CB_POL_L2_03-System-and-Network

**Objective:** IT administrators implement the technical security requirements operationally. Without practical guidance for access management, system hardening, vulnerability handling, and logging, policies are implemented inconsistently.

This handbook translates the requirements from CB_POL_L2_01 (Access and Identity) and CB_POL_L2_03 (System and Network Security) into concrete instructions for administrators. It covers access management, system hardening, vulnerability handling, logging, and backup administration.

The instructions reference the deployed IT systems and tools. The associated processes are defined in CB_PRC_02 (Access Control), CB_PRC_04 (Vulnerability Management), and CB_PRC_03 (Backup and Recovery).

**Scope:** IT administrators and system operators with privileged access. Covers all administered IT systems, endpoints, and network components.
