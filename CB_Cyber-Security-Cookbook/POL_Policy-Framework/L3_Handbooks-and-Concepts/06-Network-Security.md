# Network Security Handbook

## Summary

<!-- TODO -->

## Objective and Scope

**Standard reference:** CB_POL_L2_03-System-and-Network

**Objective:** Networks connect all IT systems and thus form the backbone of the organization — but they are also the primary attack vector for lateral movement. Without practical requirements for network architecture, segmentation, and service hardening, networks remain insecurely configured.

This handbook translates the requirements from CB_POL_L2_03 (System and Network Security) into concrete network security instructions. It defines architecture requirements, segmentation rules, and controls for network service protection.

The requirements apply to all network components within the ISMS scope. Implementation is carried out by IT administrators (CB_POL_L3_02-Admin-Handbook) and verified through vulnerability management (CB_PRC_04).

**Scope:** Network administrators and IT security officers. Covers all network segments, firewalls, VPN gateways, and network services.
