# Developer Handbook

## Summary

<!-- TODO -->

## Objective and Scope

**Standard reference:** CB_POL_L2_04-Secure-Development
**Condensed by:** —

**Objective:** Security vulnerabilities in software frequently arise from a lack of guidance during the development process. Without practical requirements for secure coding, security testing, and deployment, vulnerabilities only become visible in production.

This handbook translates the requirements from CB_POL_L2_04 (Secure Development) into concrete instructions for developers. It covers secure coding rules, security testing procedures, SDLC requirements, and change/deployment management.

The instructions reference the deployed development tools and CI/CD pipelines. The change process is defined in CB_PRC_05 (Change Management).

**Scope:** Developers, QA personnel, and DevOps engineers. Covers all in-house developments and organization-specific software customizations.
