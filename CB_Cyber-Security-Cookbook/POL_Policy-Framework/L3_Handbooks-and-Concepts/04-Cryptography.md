# Cryptography Handbook

## Summary

<!-- TODO -->

## Objective and Scope

**Standard reference:** CB_POL_L2_01-Access-and-Identity, CB_POL_L2_02-Information-Protection
**Condensed by:** —

**Objective:** Weak or improperly applied cryptography compromises the protection of confidential information. Without practical requirements for algorithms, key lengths, and key management, heterogeneous and insecure implementations arise.

This handbook translates the requirements from CB_POL_L2_01 (Access and Identity) and CB_POL_L2_02 (Information Protection) into concrete cryptographic standards. It defines approved algorithms, minimum key lengths, authentication mechanisms, and key management procedures.

The requirements apply to all IT systems and applications that use cryptographic functions. Compliance is verified through system hardening (CB_POL_L3_02-Admin-Handbook) and security testing (CB_POL_L3_03-Developer-Handbook).

**Scope:** IT administrators and developers who implement or configure cryptographic functions. Covers encryption, authentication, and digital signatures.
