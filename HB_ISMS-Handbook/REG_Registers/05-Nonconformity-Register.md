# Nonconformity Register

## Summary

<!-- TODO -->

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** Nonconformities without central documentation are neither tracked nor analysed in their root cause — recurring failures are the consequence. Evidence of systematic NC treatment is a mandatory component of every certification.

The register documents all ISMS nonconformities with type, root cause, actions taken and effectiveness review. It turns individual findings into traceable improvement impulses and creates the audit trail for corrective actions.

The NC process is defined in CB_PRC_10 (Nonconformity Management); inputs come from internal audits (CB_PRC_08), management reviews (CB_PRC_09) and performance monitoring (CB_PRC_11). Results feed as an improvement source into HB_CLS_10.1 (Continual Improvement).

**Scope:** All ISMS nonconformities from internal and external sources. Target audience: ISO (coordination), affected role holders (implementation), auditors (evidence).
