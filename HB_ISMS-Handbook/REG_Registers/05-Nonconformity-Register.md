# Nonconformity Register

## Summary

Nonconformities without systematic documentation and root cause analysis lead to recurring failures and erode ISMS effectiveness. The Nonconformity Register captures all ISMS deviations, including their root causes, corrective actions, and effectiveness reviews as required by Clause 10.2. It enables evidence-based continual improvement, provides the audit trail for certification, and transforms individual findings into traceable corrective measures. Without structured NC documentation, recurring issues remain unaddressed and mandatory audit evidence is missing.

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** Nonconformities without central documentation are neither tracked nor analysed in their root cause — recurring failures are the consequence. Evidence of systematic NC treatment is a mandatory component of every certification.

The register documents all ISMS nonconformities with type, root cause, actions taken and effectiveness review. It turns individual findings into traceable improvement impulses and creates the audit trail for corrective actions.

The NC process is defined in CB_PRC_10 (Nonconformity Management); inputs come from internal audits (CB_PRC_08), management reviews (CB_PRC_09) and performance monitoring (CB_PRC_11). Results feed as an improvement source into HB_CLS_10.1 (Continual Improvement).

**Scope:** All ISMS nonconformities from internal and external sources. Target audience: CISO (coordination), affected role holders (implementation), auditors (evidence).

## NC Entries

| NC ID | Detection date | Source | Description | Root cause | Corrective action | Responsible | Target date | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [NC-001] | [YYYY-MM-DD] | [Internal audit/External audit/Incident/Management review/Performance monitoring] | [NC description] | [Root cause analysis result] | [Corrective action description] | [Responsible person/role] | [YYYY-MM-DD] | [Open/In progress/Closed] |

**Source:** Internal audit (findings from CB_PRC_08), External audit (certification body findings), Incident (security incidents or near-misses), Management review (findings from CB_PRC_09), Performance monitoring (KPI deviations from CB_PRC_11).

**Status:** Open (newly identified, not yet addressed), In progress (corrective action implementation ongoing), Closed (corrective action implemented and effectiveness verified).

## Effectiveness Review

| NC ID | Review date | Effective | Evidence | Reviewer | Follow-up required |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [NC-001] | [YYYY-MM-DD] | [Yes/No] | [Evidence description] | [Reviewer name/role] | [Yes — description / No] |

Effectiveness reviews are conducted after implementation of corrective actions to verify that the root cause has been addressed (Clause 10.2 d).

## Responsibilities

- **Maintenance:** CISO with support from affected role holders
- **Trigger:** New nonconformity, corrective action completion, effectiveness review due date
- **Process:** CB_PRC_10-Nonconformity-Management
