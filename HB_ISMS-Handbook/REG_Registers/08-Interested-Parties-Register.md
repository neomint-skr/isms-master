# Interested Parties Register

## Summary

Scope definition and risk assessment require a current overview of stakeholders and their IS requirements. This register records the relevant parties by category, their expectations and the ISMS measures derived from them as the central data basis (SSOT). The data feeds into the scope definition (HB_CLS_4.3) and risk assessment (HB_CLS_8.2). Without current stakeholder data, regulatory obligations are overlooked or customer expectations are not addressed.

## Objective and Scope

**Requirements:** HB_CLS_4.2-Interested-Parties defines the criteria.
**Process:** Annual review during management review (CB_PRC_09).

**Objective:** Customers, authorities, employees and other parties place IS requirements on the organization that the ISMS must address. Without a central data basis for this stakeholder information, downstream processes lack the decision basis.

The register records the relevant parties by category (top management, employees, customers, suppliers, authorities) with their IS requirements. It is the single source (SSOT) for stakeholder data accessed by CLS 4.3 (Scope) and CLS 8.2 (Risk Assessment).

The identification criteria are defined by HB_CLS_4.2 (Interested Parties); annual review takes place during the management review (CB_PRC_09). Changes in the stakeholder landscape trigger a reassessment of the risk posture and, if necessary, an adjustment of the ISMS scope.

**Scope:** All parties with IS requirements on the organization. Target audience: ISO (maintenance), top management (alignment), auditors (evidence).
