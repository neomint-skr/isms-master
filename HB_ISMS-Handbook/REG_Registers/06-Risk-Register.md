# Risk Register

## Summary

<!-- TODO -->

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** Risks that are not documented can neither be evaluated nor treated — risk management remains an unsubstantiated claim. Without a risk register, the auditor lacks the central evidence of risk identification and evaluation.

The register documents all identified IS risks with asset reference, threat, vulnerability, evaluation (likelihood x impact) and treatment status. It provides the decision basis for the prioritization of controls.

Risk evaluation follows the criteria in CB_POL_L2_11 (Risk Management) and the workflow in CB_PRC_07 (Risk Management). Risks above the acceptance threshold are addressed in the risk treatment plan (HB_REG_07) and tracked through the management review (CB_PRC_09).

**Scope:** All IS risks within the ISMS scope. Target audience: Risk owners (evaluation), CISO (analysis), top management (acceptance decision), auditors (evidence).
