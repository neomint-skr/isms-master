# Context Register

## Summary

Scope definition and risk assessment require current data on industry, legal framework, market environment and internal structure. This register records the organizational profile as well as external and internal issues as the central data basis (SSOT) for the organizational context. The data feeds into the scope definition (HB_CLS_4.3) and risk assessment (HB_CLS_8.2). Without current context data, controls are based on outdated assumptions.

## Objective and Scope

**Requirements:** HB_CLS_4.1-Organization-and-Context defines the criteria.
**Process:** Annual review during management review (CB_PRC_09).

**Objective:** Industry, legal framework, technology landscape and market environment determine which information security requirements apply to the organization. Without a central data basis for these context factors, downstream processes lack the decision basis.

The register records the organizational profile (basic data, organizational units, sites), external issues (market, regulation, threats) and internal issues (structure, processes, IT). It is the single source (SSOT) for organizational baseline data accessed by CLS 4.3 (Scope) and CLS 8.2 (Risk Assessment).

The identification criteria are defined by HB_CLS_4.1 (Organization and Context); annual review takes place during the management review (CB_PRC_09). Changed context factors trigger a reassessment of the risk posture and, if necessary, an adjustment of the ISMS scope.

**Scope:** All IS-relevant context factors of the organization. Target audience: ISO (maintenance), top management (validation), auditors (evidence).

## Organizational Profile

The organizational profile describes the context in which the ISMS operates. It forms the basis for determining external and internal issues (Clause 4.1) and is validated annually during the management review (CB_PRC_09).
