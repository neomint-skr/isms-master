# Supplier Register

## Summary

<!-- TODO -->

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** Suppliers and cloud services process organizational data and influence the IS risk posture — without central documentation, there is no overview of dependencies and contractual security agreements. Missing supplier assessment is a frequent audit finding.

The register records all IS-relevant suppliers and cloud services with contract status, security requirements and assessment results. It provides the basis for supplier governance and the evaluation of third-party risks.

Supplier assessment is governed through CB_PRC_06 (Supplier Management) and aligned with the requirements from CB_POL_L2_05 (Suppliers and Cloud). Results feed into the risk assessment (CB_PRC_07) and the management review (CB_PRC_09).

**Scope:** All suppliers and cloud services with access to organizational data or IS-relevant service delivery. Target audience: IS-Coordinator (maintenance), domain departments (reporting), CISO (assessment), auditors (evidence).
