# Statement of Applicability (SoA)

## Summary

<!-- TODO -->

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** Certification to ISO 27001 requires a documented, justified decision on the application of each of the 93 Annex A controls. Without a SoA, the auditor lacks the central evidence of control selection and implementation status.

The SoA documents the applicability decision, justification and current implementation status for each control. It serves as the SSOT for control applicability and as the governance basis for ISMS implementation.

Control selection takes place during risk treatment (CB_PRC_07, HB_CLS_8.3) and is derived in the coverage matrix (INDEX.md) for navigation. The management review (CB_PRC_09) reviews the SoA status annually.

**Scope:** All 93 Annex A controls. Target audience: ISO (maintenance), top management (approval), auditors (evidence).
