# IS Objectives Register

## Summary

<!-- TODO -->

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** IS objectives without systematic tracking remain declarations of intent without measurable progress. Without a register, evidence of objective achievement is lacking — a central audit point in every certification audit.

The register records IS objectives with metrics, responsibilities, deadlines and achievement status. It provides the data basis for performance monitoring and the identification of improvement needs.

Objectives are derived from HB_CLS_6.2 (IS Objectives) and monitored through CB_PRC_11 (Performance Monitoring). Results feed as input into the management review (CB_PRC_09).

**Scope:** All IS objectives within the ISMS scope. Target audience: CISO (maintenance and monitoring), top management (objective achievement), auditors (evidence).

## IS Objectives

The organization's IS objectives are structured at three levels:

| Level | Character | Defined by | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| Strategic | Formally documented in IS policy | Top management | "Protect critical business processes against IS risks" |
| Tactical | Derived from continual improvement | ISMS team | "Reduce vulnerability backlog by 30% p.a." |
| Operational | Concrete expectations for IS controls | Domain leads | [Measurable operational objectives, e.g. "RTO for core systems < 4 hours"] |

Objectives cascade: strategic objectives are translated into tactical objectives, which in turn determine operational targets. All objectives must be measurable (if practicable), consistent with the IS policy and backed by resources (Clause 6.2).
