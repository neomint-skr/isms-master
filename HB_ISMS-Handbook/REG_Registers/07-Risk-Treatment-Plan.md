# Risk Treatment Plan

## Summary

<!-- TODO -->

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** Identified risks without a concrete treatment plan remain untreated — risk acceptance without a treatment decision is not conscious governance. Without a documented treatment plan, there is no evidence that residual risks have been consciously accepted (Clause 6.1.3 e).

The risk treatment plan assigns each risk requiring treatment a control, a responsible person, a timeframe and the expected residual risk value. It makes risk governance operationally actionable and traceable.

Treatment decisions are derived from the risk register (HB_REG_06) and developed in the risk management process (CB_PRC_07). Top management approves the plan and formally accepts residual risks; implementation progress is tracked in the management review (CB_PRC_09).

**Scope:** All risks above the acceptance threshold (CB_POL_L2_11). Target audience: Risk owners (implementation), ISO (tracking), top management (approval), auditors (evidence).
