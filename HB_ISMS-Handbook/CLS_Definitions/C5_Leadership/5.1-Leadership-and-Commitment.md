# Leadership and Commitment

## Summary

Without visible support from top management, any ISMS remains ineffective. This document maps the seven leadership commitments — from guideline adoption to resource provision — to the ISMS documents and processes. Demonstrable leadership is a prerequisite for ISMS acceptance within the organization. If top management commitment is lacking, this is assessed as a major nonconformity during audit.

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** Information security cannot be achieved through technical controls alone — it requires decisions on resources, priorities, and strategic direction that only top management can make. Without visible commitment from top management, the ISMS lacks enforcement authority.

The seven leadership commitments ensure that top management actively fulfils its ISMS role — from guideline adoption through resource provision to promoting continual improvement. Demonstrating this commitment is a fundamental prerequisite for certification.

Each commitment (Clause 5.1 a-g) is assigned to an implementing document or process — from CB_POL_L1_01 (guideline) through HB_CLS_7.1 (resources) to CB_PRC_10 (continual improvement). The management review (CB_PRC_09) serves as the central evidence of an active leadership role.

**Scope:** Top management ([CEO], [CTO]) as responsible parties. Target audience: top management (obligation), auditors (evidence).

## Top Management Commitments

Top management ([CEO], [CTO]) demonstrates leadership and commitment through the following actions (addresses A.5.4):

| # | Commitment (Clause 5.1) | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| a | Guideline and IS objectives aligned with strategic direction | CB_POL_L1_01-Guideline (principles G1-G6), HB_CLS_6.2 (objectives) |
| b | Integration of IS requirements into business processes | Operational processes CB_PRC_01..12 |
| c | Provision of required resources | HB_CLS_7.1 (resources), annual budget |
| d | Communication of the importance of effective IS | CB_AWR_01 (awareness), HB_CLS_7.4 (communication) |
| e | Ensuring the ISMS achieves its intended outcomes | CB_PRC_11 (KPI monitoring), CB_PRC_09 (management review) |
| f | Directing and supporting persons | CB_POL_L2_10 (personnel), HB_CLS_7.2 (competence) |
| g | Promoting continual improvement | CB_PRC_10 (continual improvement), HB_CLS_10.1 (improvement) |

Evidence of commitment is provided through the IS guideline (CB_POL_L1_01), regular management reviews (CB_PRC_09), and documented resource provision.
