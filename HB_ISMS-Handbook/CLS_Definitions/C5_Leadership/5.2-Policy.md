# Information Security Guideline

## Summary

The IS guideline is the strategic foundation of the ISMS and an expression of top management commitment. This document defines the seven requirements for the guideline — from fitness for purpose to communication — and demonstrates their fulfilment. The guideline anchors information security as an organizational objective and forms the basis for all downstream policies. Without a valid, communicated guideline, the ISMS lacks strategic legitimacy.

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** Without a guideline adopted by top management, the ISMS lacks strategic legitimacy. The guideline articulates the organization's intent to establish information security as a business objective and forms the basis for all downstream policies.

The seven requirements for the IS guideline ensure that it is fit for purpose, binding, current, and accessible to all parties involved. It anchors the commitment to IS objectives, compliance, and continual improvement.

The operational implementation of the requirements is carried out in CB_POL_L1_01 (principles P1-P6), supplemented by the communication plan (HB_CLS_7.4) and document control (CB_POL_L2_08). The annual adequacy review is integrated into the management review (CB_PRC_09).

**Scope:** IS guideline as a central document. Target audience: top management (adoption), ISMS team (implementation), auditors (evidence).

## Requirements for the IS Guideline

| # | Requirement (Clause 5.2) | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| a | Appropriate to the purpose of the organization | CB_POL_L1_01: Principles P1-P6 derived from organizational context (HB_CLS_4.1) |
| b | Include IS objectives or provide framework | CB_POL_L1_01: Principles provide framework; specific objectives in HB_CLS_6.2 |
| c | Commitment to fulfilling applicable requirements | CB_POL_L1_01: Principle P2 (compliance) |
| d | Commitment to continual improvement | CB_POL_L1_01: Principle P5 (continual improvement) |
| e | Available as documented information | CB_POL_L1_01 versioned and controlled (CB_POL_L2_08) |
| f | Communicated within the organization | CB_AWR_02 (onboarding), HB_CLS_7.4 (communication plan) |
| g | Available to interested parties as appropriate | CB_POL_L1_01 classified as Internal (not Confidential) |

The IS guideline is reviewed for adequacy at least annually as part of the management review (CB_PRC_09).
