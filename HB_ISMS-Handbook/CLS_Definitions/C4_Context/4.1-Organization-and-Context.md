# Organization and Context

## Summary

ISO 27001 requires the organization to understand and document its context (Clause 4.1). This document maps the requirement to specific implementations — from the organizational profile through external and internal issues to the review cycle. The mapping table ensures traceability for auditors. Without explicit mapping, clause fulfilment cannot be demonstrated.

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** Clause 4.1 requires the organization to determine external and internal issues relevant to its purpose and to the achievement of ISMS objectives. Without traceable mapping between requirements and their implementation, audit evidence is lacking.

This document maps each sub-requirement to a specific implementation location: organizational profile, external issues, internal issues, and review cycle. The mapping table shows where each requirement is fulfilled and how currency is ensured.

All context data is recorded in the Context Register (HB_REG_09) as SSOT. The results feed into the scope definition (HB_CLS_4.3) and risk assessment (HB_CLS_6.1).

**Scope:** All IS-relevant external and internal issues. Target audience: ISMS team (maintenance), auditors (evidence).

## Implementation

The organization determines and documents the following aspects:

| Aspect | Implementation |
|---|---|
| External issues | HB_REG_09 (section External Issues) |
| Internal issues | HB_REG_09 (section Internal Issues) |
| Organizational profile | HB_REG_09 (section Organizational Profile) |
| Review | Annually during management review (CB_PRC_09) or event-driven |

The results feed into the risk assessment (HB_CLS_6.1) and the scope definition (HB_CLS_4.3).
