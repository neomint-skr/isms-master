# Interested Parties

## Summary

ISO 27001 requires the organization to determine relevant interested parties and their IS requirements (Clause 4.2). This document maps the three sub-requirements to specific implementations — stakeholder identification, requirements capture, and ISMS assignment. The mapping table ensures traceability for auditors. Without explicit mapping, clause fulfilment cannot be demonstrated.

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** Clause 4.2 requires the organization to determine relevant interested parties, capture their requirements, and establish which of these are addressed through the ISMS. Without traceable mapping between requirements and their implementation, audit evidence is lacking.

This document maps the three sub-requirements (a-c) to specific implementation locations: stakeholder identification and requirements capture in the Interested Parties Register (HB_REG_08), ISMS assignment via SoA (HB_REG_02) and scope (HB_CLS_4.3). The mapping table shows where each requirement is fulfilled.

All stakeholder data is recorded in the Interested Parties Register (HB_REG_08) as SSOT. The results, alongside the organizational context (HB_CLS_4.1), feed into the scope definition and the risk assessment (HB_CLS_6.1).

**Scope:** All stakeholders with IS requirements towards the organization. Target audience: ISMS team (maintenance), auditors (evidence).

## Requirements

| # | Requirement (Clause 4.2) | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| a | Determine relevant interested parties | HB_REG_08 (stakeholder table) |
| b | Determine relevant requirements of these parties | HB_REG_08 (Requirements column) |
| c | Determine requirements addressed through the ISMS | HB_REG_02-SoA + HB_CLS_4.3-Scope |

Currency is reviewed annually during management review (CB_PRC_09) or event-driven.
