# Awareness

## Summary

Technical controls are ineffective if employees fail to recognize risks. This document defines the three awareness requirements: knowledge of the IS guideline, understanding of one's contribution to ISMS effectiveness and awareness of the consequences of non-fulfilment. Awareness forms the human line of defence within the ISMS. Without a targeted awareness programme, social engineering attacks remain the most likely cause of IS incidents.

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** Technical controls are ineffective if employees fail to recognize social engineering attacks or are unaware of security requirements. People remain the most frequent attack vector and at the same time the most important line of defence.

The three awareness requirements ensure that all employees know the IS guideline, understand their individual contribution to ISMS effectiveness and are aware of the consequences of non-fulfilment. Awareness complements technical competence (HB_CLS_7.2) with security consciousness in daily work.

The IS guideline is communicated through CB_POL_L1_01, awareness content is delivered via CB_AWR_01/02 and the training programme is governed by CB_POL_L2_10. Onboarding of new employees is covered by CB_AWR_02.

**Scope:** All employees and persons working under the organization's supervision. Target audience: ISO (awareness programme), all employees (addressees), auditors (evidence).

## Requirements

Persons working under the organization's control shall be aware of:

| # | Requirement | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| a | The IS guideline | CB_POL_L1_01-Guideline (principles P1-P6) |
| b | Their contribution to ISMS effectiveness, including the benefits of improved IS performance | CB_AWR_01, CB_AWR_02 (awareness materials) |
| c | The consequences of not conforming to ISMS requirements | CB_POL_L2_10 (training programme, onboarding) |
