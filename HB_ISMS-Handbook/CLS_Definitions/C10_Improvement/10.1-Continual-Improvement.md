# Continual Improvement

## Summary

An ISMS is never finished — it must continuously adapt to changing threats, technologies and requirements. This document describes six improvement sources — from audit results through incident analysis to measurement data — and their assignment to ISMS processes. The continual improvement approach ensures that the ISMS does not stagnate but evolves systematically. Without a demonstrable improvement process, the ISMS loses its effectiveness and certification readiness over time.

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** An ISMS is never finished — threats, technologies and requirements change continuously. Without a systematic improvement process, the ISMS loses its effectiveness and certification readiness over time.

The continual improvement approach ensures that improvement impulses from six sources are systematically recognized, prioritized and translated into concrete actions. It turns weaknesses and lessons learned into sustainable advancement of the ISMS.

The six sources (audits, NC analysis, management review, incidents, measurement results, external audits) are assigned to the supplying ISMS processes. The management review (CB_PRC_09) serves as the central prioritization point for top management.

**Scope:** Entire ISMS (all processes and controls). Target audience: ISO (identification), top management (prioritization), auditors (evidence).

## Improvement Sources

Improvement opportunities are identified from the following sources:

| # | Source | Assignment |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Internal audit results | CB_PRC_08, HB_CLS_9.2 |
| 2 | External audit results | [Certification audit / customer audit] |
| 3 | Analysis of nonconformities and corrective actions | CB_PRC_10, HB_CLS_10.2 |
| 4 | Management review results | CB_PRC_09, HB_CLS_9.3 |
| 5 | Lessons learned from IS incidents | CB_PRC_06, HB_REG_04 |
| 6 | Monitoring and measurement results | CB_PRC_11, HB_CLS_9.1 |

Identified actions are prioritized and incorporated into ISMS planning. The effectiveness of implemented actions is reviewed.
