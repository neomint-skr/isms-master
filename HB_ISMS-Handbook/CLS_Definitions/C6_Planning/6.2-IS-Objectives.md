# IS Objectives

## Summary

Measurable IS objectives make the success of the ISMS visible and manageable. This document defines the six requirements for IS objectives, distinguishes strategic, tactical and operational objective levels and describes planning for objective achievement. IS objectives connect the guideline with concrete, measurable outcomes and provide inputs for the management review. Without defined objectives, the effectiveness of the ISMS can neither be measured nor demonstrated.

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** Without measurable objectives, neither the success nor the effectiveness of the ISMS can be demonstrated. Unclear or missing objectives cause resources to be deployed without focus and improvement potential to remain undetected.

IS objectives connect the strategic principles of the guideline with concrete, measurable outcomes at three levels (strategic, tactical, operational). They provide inputs for performance monitoring and management review.

The six requirements for IS objectives (Clause 6.2 a-f) are operationalized in the IS Objectives Register (HB_REG_01) and monitored through CB_PRC_11 (Performance Monitoring). Annual updates take place during the management review (CB_PRC_09).

**Scope:** IS objectives at all organizational levels. Target audience: Top management (setting), ISO (planning), auditors (evidence).

## Requirements for IS Objectives

Each IS objective shall meet the following criteria (Clause 6.2 a-f):

| # | Requirement | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| a | Consistent with the IS guideline | Derived from principles G1-G6 (CB_POL_L1_01) |
| b | Measurable (if practicable) | SMART criteria, measurement method in IS Objectives Register |
| c | Take into account applicable IS requirements | Reference to HB_CLS_4.2 (stakeholder requirements) |
| d | Be monitored | CB_PRC_11 (Performance Monitoring), HB_REG_01 |
| e | Be communicated | HB_CLS_7.4 (communication plan) |
| f | Be updated | Annually during management review (CB_PRC_09) |

## Three-Level Model

IS objectives are defined at three levels:

| Level | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Strategic | Anchored in the IS guideline | Protection of confidentiality, integrity and availability |
| Tactical | Improvement-oriented | [e.g. reduction of mean incident response time] |
| Operational | Concrete expectations for controls | [e.g. patch rate >= 95% within 30 days] |

## Planning of Objective Achievement

For each IS objective, the IS Objectives Register (HB_REG_01) documents:

| Element | Description |
|---|---|
| Controls | What actions will be taken to achieve the objective? |
| Resources | What resources are required? |
| Responsible | Who is responsible? |
| Timeframe | By when shall the objective be achieved? |
| Evaluation | How will the results be evaluated? |
