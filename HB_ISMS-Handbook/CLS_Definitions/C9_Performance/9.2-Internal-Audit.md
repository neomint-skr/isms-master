# Internal Audit

## Summary

Internal audits verify whether the ISMS conforms to its own and the ISO requirements and is effectively implemented and maintained. This document defines the audit objectives, distinguishes four categories of findings and describes the audit programme. Audits are the primary mechanism for early detection of weaknesses and nonconformities. Without an internal audit programme, independent review is missing — a mandatory component of any certification.

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** Internal audits are the primary mechanism for independently verifying whether the ISMS conforms to its own and the ISO requirements and is effectively implemented and maintained. Without an audit programme, early detection of weaknesses is missing — a mandatory component of any certification.

The four finding categories (observation through major nonconformity) create a uniform basis for evaluating audit findings. The audit programme ensures that all ISMS aspects are reviewed at least once within a two-year cycle.

The operational workflow (planning, execution, reporting) is defined in CB_PRC_08 (Internal Audit). Results feed as input into the management review (HB_CLS_9.3) and nonconformity treatment (HB_CLS_10.2).

**Scope:** All ISMS aspects within a two-year cycle. Target audience: ISO (execution), top management (reporting), auditors (evidence).

## Audit Objectives

Internal audits verify whether the ISMS:

- conforms to the organization's own requirements,
- conforms to the requirements of ISO 27001,
- is effectively implemented and maintained.

## Finding Categories

| Category | Description |
|---|---|
| Observation | Useful insights based on experience |
| Opportunity for improvement | Generally conformant but improvable |
| Minor nonconformity | Isolated failure, no complete system breakdown |
| Major nonconformity | Significant issue, disruption of system function |

## Audit Programme

Internal audits are performed at least annually. Following an initial full audit, annual partial audits are planned so that all ISMS aspects are reviewed at least once within two years. Audit results are reported to top management and feed into the management review (HB_CLS_9.3).

The operational workflow (planning, execution, reporting) is defined in CB_PRC_08-Internal-Audit.
