# Risk Assessment

## Summary

Risk assessments must be performed regularly and on an event-driven basis to respond to changing threat landscapes. This document defines when risk assessments are triggered, which criteria apply and how the process is structured. Regular assessments keep the risk picture current and prevent new risks from going undetected. Without a current risk assessment, controls are based on outdated assumptions — a frequent audit finding.

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** New vulnerabilities, changed business processes and regulatory developments continuously alter the IS risk landscape. Existing assessments lose their validity without regular updates.

Operational risk assessment keeps the organization's risk picture current and provides the decision basis for appropriate controls. Annual and event-driven cycles ensure that both gradual and acute changes are captured.

The workflow follows the risk management process (CB_PRC_07) and applies the evaluation criteria defined in CB_POL_L2_11. Results are documented in the risk register (HB_REG_06) and form the basis for subsequent risk treatment (HB_CLS_8.3).

**Scope:** All IS risks within the ISMS scope. Target audience: ISO (coordination), risk owners (evaluation), auditors (evidence).

## Implementation

[Organization] conducts IS risk assessments as follows:

- **Regular:** Annual risk assessment cycle, coordinated by the ISO, scheduled before the management review (CB_PRC_09).
- **Event-driven:** Upon significant changes to IT infrastructure, business processes or threat landscape. Triggers are defined in CB_PRC_07-Risk-Management (section Cycles and Triggers).
- **Criteria:** The risk criteria defined in CB_POL_L2_11-Risk-Management apply (Clause 6.1.2 a).
- **Workflow:** The complete workflow is described in CB_PRC_07-Risk-Management (section Risk Assessment).

**Documentation evidence:** HB_REG_06-Risk-Register documents the results of each risk assessment.
