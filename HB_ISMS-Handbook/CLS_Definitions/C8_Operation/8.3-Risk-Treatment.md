# Risk Treatment

## Summary

Identified risks must be treated — whether through avoidance, mitigation, transfer or conscious acceptance. This document describes the treatment options, control planning and effectiveness review of implemented controls. Documented risk treatment closes the loop from assessment to concrete improvement. If identified risks remain untreated, the effectiveness of the ISMS is not given.

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** Identified risks without a traceable treatment decision remain an open security deficit. Whether avoidance, mitigation, transfer or acceptance — each decision must be documented and justified.

Operational risk treatment closes the loop from assessment to concrete improvement. It ensures that risk owners make a conscious and verifiable decision for each identified risk.

The treatment options are normatively defined in CB_POL_L2_11; the workflow is governed by CB_PRC_07. Controls, responsible persons and deadlines are documented in the risk treatment plan (HB_REG_07), results are tracked in the risk register (HB_REG_06).

**Scope:** All identified IS risks requiring treatment. Target audience: Risk owners (implementation), ISO (review), auditors (evidence).

## Implementation

[Organization] implements the IS risk treatment plan (HB_REG_07) as follows:

- **Treatment options:** The four options (avoid, mitigate, transfer, accept) are defined in CB_POL_L2_11-Risk-Management.
- **Control planning:** For each risk, controls, responsible persons and deadlines are established in the risk treatment plan (HB_REG_07).
- **Implementation:** The responsible persons implement controls within the established timeframes.
- **Effectiveness review:** The ISO reviews the effectiveness of implemented controls and updates the risk register (HB_REG_06) with the new risk level (net risk).
- **Workflow:** The complete workflow is described in CB_PRC_07-Risk-Management (section Risk Treatment).

**Documentation evidence:** HB_REG_07-Risk-Treatment-Plan (controls and implementation status) and HB_REG_06-Risk-Register (risk treatment results).
