# Onboarding Checklist

## Summary

New employees face the highest security risk during their first weeks. This checklist defines every IS-relevant onboarding step from day one to completion. A structured process ensures no critical step is missed and acknowledgement is documented. Without it, knowledge gaps lead to avoidable security incidents.

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** New employees must be familiar with the IS rules from day one and confirm their acknowledgement. Without a structured onboarding process, knowledge gaps arise that can lead to avoidable security incidents in the first weeks.

This checklist defines the IS-relevant onboarding steps — from guideline acknowledgement and access provisioning to awareness training. It ensures that no step is missed and that acknowledgement is documented.

The checklist is used by HR managers and the IS-Coordinator during the onboarding process (CB_POL_L2_10, employment contract section). The awareness content is drawn from CB_AWR_01.

**Scope:** All new employees and external personnel at onboarding. Target audience: HR managers (execution), new employees (recipients).

## Onboarding Table

The following steps are completed for every new employee or external worker (addresses A.6.1, A.6.2).

| # | Task | Responsible | Evidence | Timeframe |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Sign confidentiality agreement (NDA) | HR | Signed NDA | Before start date |
| 2 | Acknowledge IS policies and acceptable use policy | HR | Signed acknowledgement form | Day 1 |
| 3 | Complete IS awareness training (CB_AWR_01) | [IS-Coordinator / HR] | Training completion record | Within first week |
| 4 | Set up user account with MFA enabled | [IT / system administrator] | Account creation log | Day 1 |
| 5 | Issue employee badge and configure physical access | [Facility management / HR] | Access provisioning record | Day 1 |
| 6 | Hand over IT equipment with asset tag | [IT / system administrator] | Equipment handover form | Day 1 |
| 7 | Set up email and access to required systems | [IT / system administrator] | Access provisioning record | Day 1 |
| 8 | Communicate reporting channels for security incidents | [IS-Coordinator / HR] | Part of awareness training | Within first week |

Upon completion, the line manager and HR confirm all steps are done. The completed checklist is stored as evidence in the employee file (addresses A.6.6).

Screening and background verification requirements are defined in the employment terms (addresses A.6.1). The scope of screening depends on the role's access to sensitive information.
