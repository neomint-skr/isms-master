# Access Control Process

## Summary

<!-- TODO -->

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** Access rights must be provisioned, reviewed, and revoked systematically. Without a defined process, excessive permissions and orphaned accounts accumulate — one of the most common causes of security incidents.

This process defines the workflow from access request through approval and privileged access to recertification and revocation. It ensures that the principle of least privilege is enforced consistently.

The process operationalizes the requirements from CB_POL_L2_01-Access-and-Identity. Access decisions are documented and verified through regular recertification cycles.

**Scope:** All logical access rights to IT systems and information within the ISMS scope. Triggers: onboarding, role change, offboarding, or scheduled recertification.
