# Vulnerability Management Process

## Summary

<!-- TODO -->

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** New vulnerabilities in software and systems are published daily. Without a defined process for identification, assessment, and remediation, known vulnerabilities remain systematically untreated.

This process defines the workflow from vulnerability identification through risk assessment to patching and verification. It ensures that critical vulnerabilities are prioritized and remediated promptly.

The process operationalizes the requirements from CB_POL_L2_03-System-and-Network. Identified vulnerabilities are assessed and, where necessary, recorded as risks in HB_REG_RR.

**Scope:** All IT systems, applications, and network components within the ISMS scope. Triggers: vulnerability advisory, scan result, or threat intelligence information.
