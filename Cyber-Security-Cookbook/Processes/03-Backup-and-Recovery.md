# Backup and Recovery Process

## Summary

<!-- TODO -->

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** Data loss through technical failure, cyber attacks, or human error can bring business-critical processes to a standstill. Without a defined backup and recovery process, the foundation for a planned recovery is absent.

This process defines the workflow from backup strategy and execution through recovery procedures to regular restoration tests. It ensures that backup intervals and recovery times meet business requirements.

The process operationalizes the requirements from CB_POL_L2_06-Business-Continuity and CB_POL_L3_05-Data-Backup. Technical specifications for backup targets and methods are defined there.

**Scope:** All business-critical IT systems and datasets within the ISMS scope. Triggers: backup schedule, recovery request, or scheduled test run.
