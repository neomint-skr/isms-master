# Management Review Process

## Summary

<!-- TODO -->

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** The management review is top management's central steering instrument for the ISMS. Without a defined process, the structured consolidation of all inputs and the traceable derivation of improvement actions are absent.

This process defines the workflow from scheduling and preparation (seven inputs per Clause 9.3.2) through the conduct of the review to outputs and action tracking. It ensures that top management makes informed decisions on ISMS governance.

The process operationalizes the requirements from HB_CLS_9.3 (Management Review). Documentation is produced using CB_TPL_01 (Management Review Template), and actions feed into HB_REG_01 (IS Objectives Register).

**Scope:** Overall ISMS review (at least annually). Triggers: annual scheduled date or extraordinary events.

## Scheduling and frequency

<!-- TODO: At least annual, extraordinary events -->

## Preparation and inputs

<!-- TODO: Compile inputs per Clause 9.3.2 -->

## Conduct

<!-- TODO: Agenda, participants, decision process -->

## Outputs and actions

<!-- TODO: Outputs per Clause 9.3.3, action tracking -->
