# Frequently Asked Questions on Information Security

## Summary

Recurring questions consume advisory capacity unnecessarily. This FAQ answers the most frequent everyday questions on information security. It delivers consistent, correct information to all employees. Without this resource, employees act on wrong assumptions or remain uncertain.

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** Recurring questions on information security consume advisory capacity unnecessarily. Without a central point of reference for common questions, employees search at length or act on incorrect assumptions.

This FAQ answers the most frequent IS questions encountered in day-to-day work — from remote working rules and personal devices to incident reporting. It relieves the Chief Information Security Officer and ensures consistent, accurate answers.

The FAQ forms part of the awareness programme and is provided as a complement to CB_Getting-Started (Getting Started) and CB_AWR_01 (Awareness Fundamentals). New questions are added on an as-needed basis.

**Scope:** All employees. Self-service reference for everyday IS questions.

## Questions and Answers

### Do I have to read all of this?

No, start with Getting Started and the Emergency Card. Those documents cover the essentials. The rest of the Cookbook is reference material. You use it when you need it.

### What happens if I report an incident?

You will not get in trouble for reporting. Reporting is encouraged and protected. The CISO investigates and coordinates the response. Early reports reduce damage and help protect everyone.

### Does this apply when working remotely?

Yes, all information security rules apply regardless of location. Remote work may require additional precautions. The same principles protect both you and the organization. Refer to CB_AWR_01 for remote work specifics.

### May I use my personal device?

Only if approved by [Organization]. Personal devices must meet security requirements before use. Unapproved devices pose risks to company data. Contact the IS-Coordinator if you need device approval.

### Who is the CISO and what do they do?

The CISO is responsible for information security strategy and policy. They advise management and coordinate all security measures. They are your contact for policy questions. Contact: [contact channel].

### Where do I report what?

Security incidents go to the CISO immediately. Technical problems go to the IT Service Desk. Policy questions go to the IS-Coordinator. Refer to the Emergency Card for contact details.

### What makes a good password?

Use at least 12 characters with mixed letters, numbers, and symbols (addresses A.5.17). Never reuse passwords across services. Use a password manager to generate and store them. Change passwords immediately if you suspect compromise.

### Why should I lock my screen?

Unlocked screens expose data to unauthorized people (addresses A.8.1). Anyone can access your work in seconds. Locking takes one second and protects everything. Lock your screen whenever you step away.

### What is the clean desk policy?

Remove all documents and media from your desk when unattended (addresses A.7.7). Confidential materials must be locked away overnight. This prevents unauthorized access and data loss. A clear desk protects information even during breaks.

### How do I recognize social engineering?

Be suspicious of urgent requests, especially for passwords or money. Verify requests through a separate channel, never the one provided. Attackers exploit trust and time pressure. When in doubt, contact the CISO.

### May I use USB devices?

Only approved USB devices are permitted (addresses A.8.1). Unapproved devices may contain malware or leak data. Contact the IS-Coordinator for device approval. Never insert unknown USB devices into company systems.

### May I use private email for work?

No, use only corporate email for work communication. Private email lacks security controls and audit trails. Work data belongs on work systems. This protects both you and [Organization].
