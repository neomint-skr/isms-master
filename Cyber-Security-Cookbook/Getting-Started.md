# Getting Started

## Summary

This page is your entry point to the Cyber Security Cookbook. It explains why information security concerns everyone and how the Cookbook is structured. You will find your first steps and key contact points. This saves you time and helps you navigate the ISMS quickly.

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** Employees need a quick entry point into the information security documentation. Without orientation, it remains unclear why the Cookbook exists, how it is structured, and what is expected of each individual.

This getting-started page explains the purpose of the Cyber Security Cookbook, describes its structure, and highlights the most important starting points. It answers the question "Where do I begin?" in under two minutes.

The page is the recommended starting point for all employees and links to CB_AWR_01 (Awareness), CB_Emergency-Card (Emergency Card) and CB_FAQ (FAQ) as next steps.

**Scope:** All employees and external personnel. Entry document for the Cyber Security Cookbook.

## Why this Cookbook?

Information security is not just an IT topic. Every employee handles sensitive information daily. A phishing email, a weak password, or an unlocked workstation can compromise [Organization]'s data.

This Cookbook provides you with clear rules and tools. It helps you protect our assets and comply with legal requirements (addresses A.6.3). You do not need technical expertise. You just need to know where to look.

## How is it structured?

The Cookbook is organized into four areas:

| Area | Content |
|---|---|
| Policy Framework (POL) | Rules and principles: Policy, Standards, Handbooks |
| Awareness (AWR) | Training materials and onboarding |
| Processes (PRC) | Workflows for incidents, access, backup, and more |
| Templates (TPL) | Ready-made forms for daily work |

Each area has a clear purpose. Start with Awareness and the Emergency Card.

## What do you need to do?

Follow these five steps to get started:

1. Read the Emergency Card and keep it accessible
2. Complete the Awareness Training (CB_AWR_01)
3. Review the Onboarding Checklist with your manager (CB_AWR_02)
4. Set up your password according to the policy
5. Know your contact points (see next section)

These steps take less than one hour. They give you the foundation for secure daily work.
