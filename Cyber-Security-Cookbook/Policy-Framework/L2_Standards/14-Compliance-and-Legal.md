# Compliance and Legal Standard

## Summary

Compliance with legal, regulatory, and contractual requirements is a fundamental prerequisite for operating an ISMS. This standard consolidates the requirements for identifying applicable legislation, protecting intellectual property and records, ensuring privacy, conducting compliance reviews, and maintaining documented operating procedures. It ensures that compliance obligations are systematically managed and verified. Without structured compliance monitoring, legal risks remain unidentified and regulatory obligations may be breached.

## Objective and Scope

**Policy reference:** P2, P5
**Operationalized by:** —

**Objective:** Organizations face a complex landscape of legal, regulatory, and contractual information security obligations. Without systematic identification and monitoring of these requirements, compliance gaps remain undetected and may result in legal consequences or loss of customer trust.

This standard defines the requirements for identifying applicable legislation, protecting intellectual property and records, ensuring privacy, conducting compliance reviews, and maintaining documented operating procedures (addresses A.5.31-5.37). It provides the normative framework for legal and regulatory compliance within the ISMS.

The standard implements the principles P2 (Compliance) and P5 (Continual improvement) of the IS policy. Compliance review results feed into the management review and the continual improvement cycle.

**Scope:** All organizational units and employees within the ISMS scope. Covers legal, regulatory, and contractual compliance obligations as well as internal policy compliance monitoring.

## Compliance

The organization ensures that all legal, regulatory, and contractual information security requirements are identified, documented, and fulfilled (addresses A.5.31).

**Requirements:**

| # | Requirement | Control |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Legal, regulatory, and contractual IS requirements are fully identified and documented up to date; a register of legal and contractual requirements is maintained | A.5.31 |
| 2 | Intellectual property is protected through defined procedures; licensing terms for software and content are observed | A.5.32 |
| 3 | Records are protected against loss, destruction, forgery, and unauthorized access, and managed according to statutory retention periods | A.5.33 |
| 4 | Data protection requirements are implemented in accordance with GDPR and applicable national regulations; a record of processing activities is maintained; a data breach policy governs breach handling including notification to competent authorities and affected individuals | A.5.34 |

### Data Breach Handling

A data breach policy defines the procedures for managing potential data breaches (addresses A.5.34):

- Qualify whether the incident involves personal data of living individuals
- Assess whether the personal data breach is likely to be a high risk to individuals' rights and freedoms
- Notify affected individuals and the competent authority within the statutory time frame
- Document all breaches in the data breach log
- Implement controls and measures to prevent recurrence

### Compliance Monitoring

Compliance with IS policies is reviewed regularly (addresses A.5.36). Where nonconformity is identified, root causes must be determined, corrective actions implemented, and their effectiveness verified. Results of compliance reviews feed into the management review. Violations may result in immediate withdrawal or suspension of system and network privileges and/or disciplinary action.

### Documented Operating Procedures

Operating procedures for information processing facilities and other relevant activities must be documented and made available to personnel who need them (addresses A.5.37). Procedures must be reviewed when changes occur in processes, technology, or organizational structures.

### Independent Review

An independent review of the organization's approach to managing information security is conducted at planned intervals or when significant changes occur (addresses A.5.35, see also HB_CLS_9.2-Internal-Audit). Review results are reported to management and feed into the continual improvement cycle.
