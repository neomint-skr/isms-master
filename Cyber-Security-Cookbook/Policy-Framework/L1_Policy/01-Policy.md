# Information Security Policy

## Summary

Information security requires strategic commitment from top management to be effective across the organization. This policy defines six principles (P1–P6) and a four-tier framework that guide all security decisions. It establishes the strategic foundation for the ISMS and ensures traceability from principles to operational controls. Without this policy, security measures lack direction, accountability, and organizational alignment.

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** Business processes and the information they handle constitute a business-critical asset of [Organization]. Without a strategic commitment by top management to information security, the foundation for all further controls and the ISMS is missing.

This policy defines six principles (P1-P6) that serve as the strategic framework for all IS decisions. It articulates top management commitment and establishes the four-tier policy framework (L1>L2>L3>L4).

The principles are translated into normative requirements through twelve L2 standards, operationalized into concrete instructions through eight L3 handbooks and concepts, and condensed into quick references through L4 cheat sheets. The allocation matrix ensures traceability from the strategic level down to operational implementation.

**Scope:** The entire organization of [Organization] — all employees, management, external personnel, and business processes within the ISMS scope.

## Management Commitment

Top management commits to establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving the ISMS. This commitment is demonstrated through:

1. **Strategic alignment:** Ensuring that the IS policy and IS objectives are consistent with the strategic objectives of the organization
2. **Integration:** Embedding IS requirements into all business processes
3. **Resource allocation:** Providing financial, technical, and human resources for the ISMS
4. **Communication:** Promoting the importance of effective IS management and ensuring that all employees understand and comply with ISMS requirements
5. **Effectiveness review:** Regularly reviewing the ISMS to ensure it achieves its objectives
6. **Support and leadership:** Encouraging and training all employees to contribute to the effectiveness of the ISMS
7. **Continual improvement:** Promoting initiatives to improve IS practices

Top management enables other management functions to demonstrate their leadership within their respective areas of responsibility.

## Information Security Objectives

[Organization] defines measurable information security objectives derived from the principles of this policy. Objectives are reviewed at least annually and updated as part of the management review.

| # | Objective | Principle | Measurement | Target | Responsible |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | [Objective description] | P1 | [KPI or metric] | [Target value] | [Role] |
| 2 | [Objective description] | P2 | [KPI or metric] | [Target value] | [Role] |
| 3 | [Objective description] | P3 | [KPI or metric] | [Target value] | [Role] |
| 4 | [Objective description] | P4 | [KPI or metric] | [Target value] | [Role] |
| 5 | [Objective description] | P5 | [KPI or metric] | [Target value] | [Role] |
| 6 | [Objective description] | P6 | [KPI or metric] | [Target value] | [Role] |

## Principles

**P1 — Protection:** [Organization] ensures confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all business processes and the information they handle. Controls are aligned with the criticality of the respective assets.

**P2 — Compliance:** Legal, contractual, and normative information security requirements are systematically identified and fulfilled.

**P3 — Risk orientation:** Security decisions are based on systematic risk assessment. Resources are allocated where the risk is greatest.

**P4 — Awareness:** Every employee knows their role in information security and acts accordingly. Training and awareness are an integral part of daily work.

**P5 — Continual improvement:** The ISMS is continually enhanced through the PDCA cycle. Incidents, audits, and KPIs drive improvements.

**P6 — Business continuity:** Critical business processes remain operational even during disruptions and emergencies. Preparedness and recovery measures are established.

## Policy Framework

This policy (L1) forms the top tier of the policy framework of [Organization]. The principles are cascaded through four tiers into the organization:

| Tier | Character | Key question |
|---|---|---|
| L1 — Policy | Strategic | WHY is information security important? |
| L2 — Standards | Normative | WHAT must be done to implement the principles? |
| L3 — Handbooks and Concepts | Operational | HOW do different employee groups implement the standards in daily work? |
| L4 — Cheat Sheets | Quick reference | AT A GLANCE — what are the key rules for daily work? |

Each L2 standard serves at least one principle. Each L3 handbook operationalizes at least one L2 standard. L4 cheat sheets condense L3 handbooks into quick references for daily use. This ensures that every operational requirement is traceable back to a strategic rationale.

### Allocation Matrix L1 > L2

| Principle | Standards (L2) |
|---|---|
| P1 Protection | L2_01 Access, L2_02 Information Protection, L2_03 System+Network, L2_04 Secure Development, L2_05 Suppliers, L2_07 Organisation, L2_09 Physical Security, L2_12 AI-Usage, L2_13 Incident+Threat |
| P2 Compliance | L2_01 Access, L2_02 Information Protection, L2_05 Suppliers, L2_07 Organisation, L2_08 Document Control, L2_12 AI-Usage, L2_14 Compliance+Operations |
| P3 Risk orientation | L2_11 Risk Management, L2_03 System+Network, L2_04 Secure Development, L2_05 Suppliers, L2_06 Business Continuity, L2_07 Organisation, L2_09 Physical Security, L2_13 Incident+Threat |
| P4 Awareness | L2_07 Organisation, L2_10 Human Resources |
| P5 Continual improvement | L2_07 Organisation, L2_08 Document Control, L2_13 Incident+Threat |
| P6 Business continuity | L2_06 Business Continuity |

## Non-Compliance Consequences

Violations of this policy and its subordinate standards may result in disciplinary measures up to and including termination of employment, in accordance with applicable labour law. For external parties, non-compliance may lead to contractual consequences including termination of the business relationship. The severity of consequences is determined proportionally based on the nature, impact, and intent of the violation.
