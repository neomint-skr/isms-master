# Impact Rubric (LRM-44)

## Purpose

This rubric ensures deterministic and comparable impact assessments. Impact is the **worst credible impact** within the defined time horizon (default: 12 months).

## Rule (binding)

Impact level = max of the applicable dimension levels (financial, legal/regulatory, operational, reputation).

If any dimension reaches Severe (4), Impact is Severe (4).

## Thresholds (to be parameterized)

Replace the bracketed values with organization-specific thresholds. Maintain the thresholds in a controlled way (document control).

| Level | Financial | Legal / Regulatory | Operational | Reputation / Customer |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Minor (1) | [< 10k] | [no material obligations] | [< 2h, local] | [limited, internal] |
| Moderate (2) | [10k–100k] | [contractual issue possible] | [2–8h, workaround possible] | [single customers impacted] |
| Major (3) | [100k–1M] | [regulatory relevance possible] | [8–24h, core process disrupted] | [broad customer impact] |
| Severe (4) | [> 1M] | [reportable / major sanctions possible] | [> 24h or critical service down] | [major reputation damage] |

## Documentation rule

For each assessed risk scenario, document a one-line rationale referencing the dimension(s) that drive the rating.
