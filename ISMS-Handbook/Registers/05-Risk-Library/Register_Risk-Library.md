# Risk Library (LRM-44)

## Summary

The Risk Library contains the binding criteria and reusable building blocks for LRM-44 risk assessments: the 4×4 matrix, impact and likelihood rubrics, the scenario library, and treatment playbooks. It enables deterministic assessments while keeping execution lean and human-friendly.

## Contents

- Matrix (4×4): `Matrix_4x4.md`
- Impact rubric: `Rubric_Impact.md`
- Likelihood rubric: `Rubric_Likelihood.md`
- Scenario library: `Library_Scenarios.md`
- Treatment playbooks: `Playbooks_Treatment.md`

## Governance

- The Risk Management Standard (`CB_POL_L2_11-Risk-Management`) references this library as binding criteria.
- Changes to rubrics and thresholds MUST be reviewed and versioned.
- Risk assessments MUST record the applicable criteria version.
