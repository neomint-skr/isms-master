# Likelihood Rubric (LRM-44)

## Purpose

This rubric ensures deterministic and comparable likelihood assessments without debating probabilities.

## Factors (yes/no)

Answer each factor with Yes/No and document 1–2 keywords as rationale.

1. Exposure: Internet-facing, wide user base, supplier remote access, or broad external interaction?
2. Threat activity: Common attack pattern or active exploitation relevant to the scope unit?
3. Control gap: Missing baseline control or no evidence that it is effective?
4. Change/complexity: Recent major changes, high complexity, or manual steps that increase error likelihood?

## Mapping (binding)

Count Yes answers:

- 0 → Rare (1)
- 1 → Unlikely (2)
- 2 → Possible (3)
- 3–4 → Likely (4)

## Documentation rule

For each assessed risk scenario, document a one-line rationale (e.g., “public endpoint, common pattern”).
