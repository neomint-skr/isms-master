# Treatment Playbooks (LRM-44)

## Purpose

Playbooks provide a default set of control options for common scenario types. They reduce cognitive load and increase consistency. They are guidance; final selection is recorded in the Risk Log and SoA.

## Format

For each scenario type:
- Scenario type
- Default controls (Annex A references)
- Typical implementation actions (tickets/changes)
- Evidence examples
