# IT Systems (Physical) — Threat Catalogue

> BSI elementary threats (G 0.1–G 0.47) assessed for relevance to the **IT systems (physical)** asset class.
> Methodology: [REF:BSI17, Ch. 8]. Only threats with direct control relevance at this asset layer are marked as relevant.

| ID | Threat | Relevant | Justification (if not relevant) |
|---|---|:---:|---|
| G 0.1 | Fire | **Yes** | |
| G 0.2 | Adverse climatic conditions | **Yes** | |
| G 0.3 | Water | **Yes** | |
| G 0.4 | Contamination, dust, corrosion | **Yes** | |
| G 0.5 | Natural disasters | No | Primarily site/building level (structural design, site selection, georedundancy/BCM). An individual physical device cannot directly control this threat effectively. |
| G 0.6 | Disasters in the vicinity | No | Surrounding/site risk; controlled via site/building/BCM measures, not at the individual device. |
| G 0.7 | Major events in the vicinity | No | Surrounding/site risk; controlled primarily via site/building/BCM planning. |
| G 0.8 | Failure or disruption of power supply | **Yes** | |
| G 0.9 | Failure or disruption of communication networks | No | Primarily communication links/network architecture/provider level; device may have redundant NICs but does not control the connection itself. |
| G 0.10 | Failure or disruption of supply networks | No | Building/infrastructure topic (e.g. cooling/water); not controllable at the device as primary level. |
| G 0.11 | Failure or disruption of service providers | No | Primarily process/provider management (SLA, maintenance, spare parts, supply chains), not the device as primary level. |
| G 0.12 | Electromagnetic interference | **Yes** | |
| G 0.13 | Interception of compromising emanations | **Yes** | |
| G 0.14 | Espionage | **Yes** | |
| G 0.15 | Eavesdropping | **Yes** | |
| G 0.16 | Theft of devices, media or documents | **Yes** | |
| G 0.17 | Loss of devices, media or documents | **Yes** | |
| G 0.18 | Inadequate planning or lack of adaptation | **Yes** | |
| G 0.19 | Disclosure of sensitive information | **Yes** | |
| G 0.20 | Information or products from unreliable sources | **Yes** | |
| G 0.21 | Manipulation of hardware or software | **Yes** | |
| G 0.22 | Manipulation of information | **Yes** | |
| G 0.23 | Unauthorized access to IT systems | **Yes** | |
| G 0.24 | Destruction of devices or media | **Yes** | |
| G 0.25 | Failure of devices or systems | **Yes** | |
| G 0.26 | Malfunction of devices or systems | **Yes** | |
| G 0.27 | Resource shortage | **Yes** | |
| G 0.28 | Software vulnerabilities or defects | **Yes** | |
| G 0.29 | Violation of laws or regulations | **Yes** | |
| G 0.30 | Unauthorized use or administration of devices and systems | **Yes** | |
| G 0.31 | Incorrect use or administration of devices and systems | **Yes** | |
| G 0.32 | Misuse of privileges | **Yes** | |
| G 0.33 | Staff absence | No | Personnel availability/deputy arrangements is primarily a process/BCM topic, not directly controllable at the device. |
| G 0.34 | Terrorist attack | No | Primarily physical security at building/room level (physical protection, access concepts). Device is affected but not the primary control level. |
| G 0.35 | Coercion, extortion or corruption | No | Primarily human/organizational threat; controlled via processes/roles/controls, not the device as primary level. |
| G 0.36 | Identity theft | **Yes** | |
| G 0.37 | Repudiation of actions | **Yes** | |
| G 0.38 | Misuse of personal data | **Yes** | |
| G 0.39 | Malware | **Yes** | |
| G 0.40 | Denial of service | **Yes** | |
| G 0.41 | Sabotage | **Yes** | |
| G 0.42 | Social engineering | No | Primarily human/process-related (awareness, control mechanisms); device is not the primary control level. |
| G 0.43 | Message injection | **Yes** | |
| G 0.44 | Unauthorized entry to premises | No | Access control/physical protection is at rooms/buildings level; device is the target but not the primary control level. |
| G 0.45 | Data loss | **Yes** | |
| G 0.46 | Loss of integrity of sensitive information | **Yes** | |
| G 0.47 | Harmful side effects of IT-based attacks | **Yes** | |
