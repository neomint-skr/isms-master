# Competence Records

## Summary

Competence evidence is a mandatory ISO 27001 requirement (Clause 7.2 d). This register documents SOLL (target) and IST (actual) competence levels per ISMS role across defined competence dimensions. Gap analysis drives development actions and provides audit evidence for competence management. Without documented competence records, auditors cannot verify the effectiveness of ISMS processes.

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** ISO 27001 requires that organizations retain documented evidence of competence for persons performing IS-relevant work. Without structured records, competence gaps remain invisible and development actions cannot be prioritized.

This register provides the SOLL/IST matrix per ISMS role, enabling gap identification and targeted development planning. The competence index (IST/SOLL ratio) per role quantifies readiness and triggers escalation when below threshold.

The register is the evidence layer for HB_CLS_7.2-Competence (competence framework) and supports the management review (Clause 9.3) with competence status data.

**Scope:** All ISMS role holders ([CISO], [IS-Coordinator], [CEO], [CTO]). Target audience: CISO (assessment), HR (evidence filing), auditors (review).

## Competence Scale

| Level | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | Basic knowledge of IS requirements |
| 2 | Good knowledge with understanding of implementation options |
| 3 | In-depth knowledge with practical implementation experience |

Competence index = sum(IST) / sum(SOLL). Values below 0.78 indicate a significant competence gap requiring external training or coaching.
