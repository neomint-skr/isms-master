# Nonconformity Register

## Summary

Nonconformities without systematic documentation and root cause analysis lead to recurring failures and erode ISMS effectiveness. The Nonconformity Register captures all ISMS deviations, including their root causes, corrective actions, and effectiveness reviews as required by Clause 10.2. The register is structured by audit source, with separate chapters for each audit cycle and per-category subsections for major nonconformities, minor nonconformities, opportunities for improvement, and observations. It enables evidence-based continual improvement, provides the audit trail for certification, and transforms individual findings into traceable corrective measures. Without structured NC documentation, recurring issues remain unaddressed and mandatory audit evidence is missing.

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** Nonconformities without central documentation are neither tracked nor analysed in their root cause — recurring failures are the consequence. Evidence of systematic NC treatment is a mandatory component of every certification.

The register documents all ISMS nonconformities with type, root cause, actions taken and effectiveness review. It turns individual findings into traceable improvement impulses and creates the audit trail for corrective actions.

The NC process is defined in CB_PRC_10 (Nonconformity Management); inputs come from internal audits (CB_PRC_08), management reviews (CB_PRC_09) and performance monitoring (CB_PRC_11). Results feed as an improvement source into HB_CLS_10.1 (Continual Improvement).

**Scope:** All ISMS nonconformities from internal and external sources. Target audience: CISO (coordination), affected role holders (implementation), auditors (evidence).

**Data breach incidents** are initially recorded in the incident management process (CB_PRC_01). Incidents that reveal ISMS nonconformities are escalated to this register for root cause analysis and corrective action tracking. The entry references the originating incident ID.

### Key
