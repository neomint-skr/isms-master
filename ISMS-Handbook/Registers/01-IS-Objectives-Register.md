# IS Objectives Register

## Summary

IS objectives define measurable security outcomes required by Clause 6.2 and must be systematically tracked to demonstrate commitment and progress. This register records all strategic, tactical and operational IS objectives with their associated KPIs, target values, achievement status and responsible parties. It serves as the primary data source for performance monitoring (CB_PRC_11) and provides mandatory input for management reviews (CB_PRC_09), enabling evidence-based decision-making. Without this register, the organization lacks verifiable evidence of objective pursuit and achievement — a critical finding in certification audits.

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** IS objectives without systematic tracking remain declarations of intent without measurable progress. Without a register, evidence of objective achievement is lacking — a central audit point in every certification audit.

The register records IS objectives with metrics, responsibilities, deadlines and achievement status. It provides the data basis for performance monitoring and the identification of improvement needs.

Objectives are derived from HB_CLS_6.2 (IS Objectives) and monitored through CB_PRC_11 (Performance Monitoring). Results feed as input into the management review (CB_PRC_09).

**Scope:** All IS objectives within the ISMS scope. Target audience: CISO (maintenance and monitoring), top management (objective achievement), auditors (evidence).

## IS Objectives

The organization's IS objectives are structured at three levels:

| Level | Character | Defined by | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| Strategic | Formally documented in IS policy | Top management | "Protect critical business processes against IS risks" |
| Tactical | Derived from continual improvement | ISMS team | "Reduce vulnerability backlog by 30% p.a." |
| Operational | Concrete expectations for IS controls | Domain leads | [Measurable operational objectives, e.g. "RTO for core systems < 4 hours"] |

Objectives cascade: strategic objectives are translated into tactical objectives, which in turn determine operational targets. All objectives must be measurable (if practicable), consistent with the IS policy and backed by resources (Clause 6.2).

## Monitoring Results

Objective achievement is measured against defined KPIs and tracked over time:

| Objective ID | Objective | Level | KPI | Target | Actual | Status | Responsible | Measurement date |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [OBJ-S01] | [Strategic objective] | Strategic | [KPI description] | [Target value] | [Actual value] | [On track/At risk/Not achieved/Achieved] | [Responsible role] | [YYYY-MM-DD] |

**Status definitions:**
- **On track:** Actual performance meets or exceeds target
- **At risk:** Performance below target but corrective action in progress
- **Not achieved:** Target missed; requires management attention
- **Achieved:** Objective completed successfully

Measurement frequency is defined per objective; results are reviewed quarterly and reported in the management review (CB_PRC_09).

## Responsibilities

- **Maintenance:** CISO with support from domain leads
- **Trigger:** Quarterly measurement, annual review during management review
- **Process:** CB_PRC_11-Performance-Monitoring
