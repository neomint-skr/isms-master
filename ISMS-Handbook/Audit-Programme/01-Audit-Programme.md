# Audit Programme

## Summary

The audit programme is the living document that captures the multi-year audit schedule, scope rotation, auditor assignments, and evidence overview. It is required documented information per ISO 27001:2022 Clause 9.2.2 and provides auditors and management with a single view of planned and completed audits. Without a documented audit programme, the organization cannot demonstrate systematic audit coverage — a mandatory certification requirement. The programme is maintained by the CISO and reviewed annually.

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** ISO 27001 Clause 9.2.2 mandates a documented audit programme that considers the importance of processes, changes affecting the organization, and results of previous audits. Without this programme, systematic audit coverage cannot be demonstrated — an immediate certification risk.

The audit programme provides auditors and management with a single view of planned and completed audits, including scope rotation to ensure full ISMS coverage over the certification cycle. It links each audit to its evidence (reports, findings) for easy retrieval.

The programme operationalizes the requirements of HB_CLS_9.2 (Internal Audit) and complements the CB_PRC_08 (Internal Audit) process. Findings are tracked in HB_REG_05 (Nonconformity Register) and evidence is stored in Audit-Programme/Records/.

**Scope:** All internal and external ISMS audits; maintained by CISO, reviewed annually.
