# Improvement Roadmap

## Summary

The improvement roadmap tracks ISMS improvement themes derived from audit findings, risk assessments, and management reviews. It consolidates improvement opportunities into a prioritized plan with timelines, owners, and status tracking. The roadmap ensures that continual improvement per Clause 10.1 is not aspirational but actionable and measurable. Without a central improvement plan, improvement impulses from multiple sources remain uncoordinated and untraceable. The roadmap is maintained by the CISO and reviewed quarterly.

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** Continual improvement is mandated by ISO 27001 Clause 10.1, yet improvements arise from multiple sources — audits, risk assessments, management reviews, incidents — with no single point of consolidation. Without a structured plan, improvement impulses remain fragmented and their implementation unverifiable.

The improvement roadmap consolidates improvement themes with priorities and timelines into a single actionable plan. It provides CISO, IS-Coordinator, and top management with a clear view of what needs to improve, by when, and who is responsible.

The roadmap operationalizes the requirements of HB_CLS_10.1 (Continual Improvement) and synthesizes inputs from HB_REG_05 (Audit Findings), HB_REG_06 (Risk Register), and HB_REG_07 (KPI Register) into a tracked execution plan.

**Scope:** CISO and IS-Coordinator; covers all ISMS improvement activities regardless of source.
