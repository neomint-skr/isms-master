# Improvement Roadmap

## Summary

The improvement roadmap tracks ISMS improvement themes derived from audit findings, risk assessments, and management reviews. It consolidates improvement opportunities into a prioritized plan with timelines, owners, and status tracking. The roadmap ensures that continual improvement per Clause 10.1 is not aspirational but actionable and measurable. Without a central improvement plan, improvement impulses from multiple sources remain uncoordinated and untraceable. The roadmap is maintained by the CISO and reviewed quarterly.

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** Continual improvement is mandated by ISO 27001 Clause 10.1, yet improvements arise from multiple sources — audits, risk assessments, management reviews, incidents — with no single point of consolidation. Without a structured plan, improvement impulses remain fragmented and their implementation unverifiable.

The improvement roadmap consolidates improvement themes with priorities and timelines into a single actionable plan. It provides CISO, IS-Coordinator, and top management with a clear view of what needs to improve, by when, and who is responsible.

The roadmap operationalizes the requirements of HB_CLS_10.1 (Continual Improvement) and synthesizes inputs from HB_REG_NC (Audit Findings), HB_REG_RR (Risk Register), and HB_REG_RT (KPI Register) into a tracked execution plan.

**Scope:** CISO and IS-Coordinator; covers all ISMS improvement activities regardless of source.

## Improvement Themes

| ID | Theme | Source | Priority | Target Date | Status | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [IMP-001] | [Theme description] | [Audit/Risk/MR/Incident] | [High/Medium/Low] | [YYYY-MM-DD] | [Open/In progress/Closed] | [Role] |

## Priority Assessment

Improvement themes are prioritized based on the following criteria to ensure effective resource allocation:

| Criterion | Description | Weight |
|---|---|---|
| Risk impact | Severity of the associated risk if the improvement is not implemented, based on HB_REG_RR risk ratings | High |
| Audit relevance | Whether the theme addresses an audit finding or nonconformity from HB_REG_NC | High |
| Regulatory urgency | Themes driven by legal or contractual obligations with fixed deadlines | High |
| Implementation effort | Estimated resources (time, budget, personnel) required for completion | Medium |
| Dependencies | Whether the theme blocks or is blocked by other improvement activities | Medium |
| Quick-win potential | Themes with low effort and high visibility that demonstrate continual improvement | Low |

Themes with high risk impact or audit relevance are prioritized first. Where multiple themes share the same priority, regulatory urgency and dependencies determine the sequence. The CISO validates the priority assessment during each quarterly review.

## Timeline

The improvement roadmap follows a quarterly review cycle aligned with the management review schedule.

### Quarterly review

The CISO reviews all open improvement themes at minimum once per quarter. The review assesses progress against target dates, adjusts priorities based on new inputs, and identifies blocked themes. Results are documented as part of the management review record (HB_CLS_9.3).

### Milestone tracking

Each improvement theme progresses through the following stages:

| Status | Definition | Transition criterion |
|---|---|---|
| Open | Theme identified and logged | Priority and owner assigned |
| In progress | Implementation work started | First deliverable produced |
| On hold | Implementation paused due to dependency or resource constraint | Blocking condition documented |
| Closed | Implementation completed and effectiveness verified | Evidence recorded, verified by CISO |

Status transitions are recorded in the improvement themes table with the date of change.

### Escalation

Themes that exceed their target date by more than one quarter are escalated to top management during the next management review. Themes in "On hold" status for more than two consecutive quarters are reviewed for cancellation or re-prioritization.
