# Meeting Log

## Summary

The meeting log is the central chronological record of all ISMS governance meetings. It provides an audit trail for management reviews, risk reviews, and IS steering committee sessions with references to key decisions and action items. The log ensures that documented evidence of governance activities exists as required by ISO 27001 Clause 9.3. Without a meeting log, the organization cannot demonstrate that governance meetings took place or what was decided. Full minutes are stored in Management/Records/.

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** ISO 27001 Clause 9.3 requires documented evidence of management reviews, and effective ISMS governance extends to risk reviews and steering committee sessions. Without a central log, evidence of governance meetings and their outcomes is scattered or absent.

The meeting log provides a central chronological record of all governance meetings with key decisions, action references, and links to detailed minutes. It enables auditors and management to trace governance activity without searching through individual records.

The log complements HB_CLS_9.3 (Management Review) requirements and the CB_PRC_09 (Management Review) process. Detailed meeting minutes are stored in Management/Records/ and linked from the log.

**Scope:** All ISMS governance meetings (management reviews, risk reviews, IS steering committee); maintained by CISO.

## Meeting Types

- **Management Review (MR):** Annual (minimum) top management review of ISMS suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness per Clause 9.3. Documented via CB_TPL_01.
- **Risk Review:** Periodic review of risk register status, treatment progress, and emerging risks. Feeds into HB_REG_06 and HB_REG_07.
- **IS Steering Committee:** Operational coordination between CISO, IS-Coordinator, and relevant stakeholders on ISMS topics.
