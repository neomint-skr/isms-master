# Open Items

## Summary

The open items list is the asynchronous working channel between CISO and the client organization. It tracks open questions, clarification needs, and blockers that arise between scheduled governance meetings. The list ensures that nothing falls through the cracks and provides a traceable record of how items were raised and resolved. Without this channel, ad-hoc communication via email or chat lacks structure and audit trail.

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** ISMS governance generates questions and decisions outside scheduled meetings — clarifications on policies, technical decisions, resource requests, or blockers. Without a structured channel, these items are scattered across email threads and chat messages with no traceability.

The open items list provides a structured, traceable channel for asynchronous CISO-client communication. Each item is tracked from creation through resolution, ensuring accountability and audit trail.

The list complements the Meeting Log (HB_MGT_02) and Improvement Roadmap (HB_MGT_01) as an operational governance tool. Open items that require formal action are escalated to the appropriate register or process.

**Scope:** CISO and IS-Coordinator; all open ISMS-related items requiring clarification or decision.

## Open Items

| ID | Date Raised | Topic | Raised By | Status | Resolution | Resolved Date |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Usage Guidelines

Items are added as they arise during ISMS work. They are reviewed in governance meetings to ensure progress and escalate where needed. Resolved items remain in the log for audit trail purposes. Items requiring formal corrective action are transferred to the appropriate register (e.g. HB_REG_NC for nonconformities, HB_MGT_01 for improvement themes).
