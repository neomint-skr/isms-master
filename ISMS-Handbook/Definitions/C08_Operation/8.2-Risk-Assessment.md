# Risk Assessment

## Summary

Risk assessments MUST be performed regularly and on an event-driven basis to respond to changes in scope, systems, suppliers and the threat landscape. This document defines when risk assessments are triggered and which binding criteria apply. The goal is a current, comparable and traceable risk picture.

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** Keep the operational risk picture current and provide a reliable decision basis for controls.

**Scope:** All information security risks within the ISMS scope. Target audience: risk owners, ISMS manager/CISO, auditors.

## Binding criteria and method

Risk assessments SHALL use **LRM-44 (4×4)** as defined in:

- Risk Management Standard: `CB_POL_L2_11-Risk-Management`
- Risk Library:
  - `ISMS-Handbook/Registers/05-Risk-Library/Matrix_4x4.md`
  - `ISMS-Handbook/Registers/05-Risk-Library/Rubric_Impact.md`
  - `ISMS-Handbook/Registers/05-Risk-Library/Rubric_Likelihood.md`
  - `ISMS-Handbook/Registers/05-Risk-Library/Library_Scenarios.md`

## Triggers (when to assess)

Risk assessments MUST be performed:
- annually (scheduled before management review),
- on major changes (new/changed systems and services, major process changes),
- after significant incidents,
- when relevant legal/regulatory requirements change,
- when threat intelligence indicates material changes.

Operational triggers are defined in `CB_PRC_07-Risk-Management`.

## Assessment approach (human-executable)

[Organization] performs risk assessment on **scope units** (systems, services, business processes):

1. Define scope unit and boundaries.
2. Select applicable scenarios from the Scenario Library (and add local scenarios if material).
3. For each material scenario:
   - assess Impact using the binding rubric,
   - assess Likelihood using the binding rubric,
   - compute Score = I × L and map to band,
   - document one-line rationale for Impact and Likelihood.

All risk entries MUST be documented as one-sentence **risk scenarios**. Threat/vulnerability catalogues MAY be used as background references but are not required for the assessment output.

## Records (documented information)

- Scope unit assessment records: `ISMS-Handbook/Registers/06-Risk-Assessments/Scope-Units/`
- Risk Log (SSOT): `ISMS-Handbook/Registers/07-Risk-Log/Register_Risk-Log.md`
