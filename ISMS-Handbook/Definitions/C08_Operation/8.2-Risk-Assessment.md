# Risk Assessment

## Summary

Risk assessments must be performed regularly and on an event-driven basis to respond to changing threat landscapes. This document defines when risk assessments are triggered, which criteria apply and how the process is structured. Regular assessments keep the risk picture current and prevent new risks from going undetected. Without a current risk assessment, controls are based on outdated assumptions — a frequent audit finding.

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** New vulnerabilities, changed business processes and regulatory developments continuously alter the IS risk landscape. Existing assessments lose their validity without regular updates.

Operational risk assessment keeps the organization's risk picture current and provides the decision basis for appropriate controls. Annual and event-driven cycles ensure that both gradual and acute changes are captured.

The workflow follows the risk management process (CB_PRC_07) and applies the evaluation criteria defined in CB_POL_L2_11. Results are documented in the risk register (HB_REG_RR) and form the basis for subsequent risk treatment (HB_CLS_8.3).

**Scope:** All IS risks within the ISMS scope. Target audience: CISO (coordination), risk owners (evaluation), auditors (evidence).

## Implementation

[Organization] conducts IS risk assessments as follows:

- **Regular:** Annual risk assessment cycle, coordinated by the CISO, scheduled before the management review (CB_PRC_09).
- **Event-driven:** Upon significant changes to IT infrastructure, business processes or threat landscape. Triggers are defined in CB_PRC_07-Risk-Management (section Cycles and Triggers).
- **Criteria:** The risk criteria defined in CB_POL_L2_11-Risk-Management apply (Clause 6.1.2 a).
- **Asset-based approach:** The risk assessment takes assets and their protection requirements from the asset register (HB_REG_AM) as starting point.
- **Protection requirements:** Before risk identification, protection requirements are verified or updated in accordance with CB_POL_L2_11-Risk-Management (section Protection Requirements Analysis).
- **Vulnerability assessment:** For each asset, the vulnerability catalogue of the corresponding asset class is evaluated using defined status values (present, not present, unknown, not applicable). Status `unknown` generates scenarios to prevent false negatives. The status logic is defined in CB_POL_L2_11-Risk-Management (section Vulnerability Assessment).
- **Scenario generation:** Risk scenarios are generated automatically from threat-vulnerability pairs where both the threat is relevant for the asset class and at least one aspect tag (C, I, A) is shared. The generation rules are defined in CB_POL_L2_11-Risk-Management (section Scenario Generation Rules).
- **Impact derivation:** The impact baseline for each scenario is derived from the protection requirement of the affected asset via the mapping table in CB_POL_L2_11-Risk-Management (section Impact Derivation from Protection Requirements). The assessor may adjust upward but not below the derived baseline.
- **Gross and net risk:** The assessment captures both gross risk (without existing controls) and net risk (with existing controls in place). Existing measures are referenced by their SM-ID from the security measures register (HB_REG_SM); their effectiveness determines the reduction applied to likelihood and/or impact.
- **Workflow:** The complete workflow is described in CB_PRC_07-Risk-Management (section Risk Assessment).

**Documentation evidence:** HB_REG_RR_01-Risk-Register documents the results of each risk assessment.
