# Risk Treatment

## Summary

Identified risks MUST be treated through avoidance, mitigation, transfer or conscious acceptance. Risk treatment closes the loop from assessment to controls and evidence. This document defines treatment options, planning requirements and how control selection is documented via the SoA.

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** Ensure that risks above acceptance criteria result in traceable treatment decisions and implemented controls.

**Scope:** All IS risks within the ISMS scope that require treatment (or require explicit acceptance).

## Treatment options (binding)

For each risk scenario, [Organization] SHALL choose one of:

- **Avoid:** discontinue or redesign the activity causing the risk.
- **Mitigate (Treat):** implement controls to reduce likelihood and/or impact.
- **Transfer:** shift parts of the risk via contracts/insurance (residual risk remains).
- **Accept:** accept residual risk according to acceptance criteria and approval level.

Acceptance criteria and approval levels are defined in `CB_POL_L2_11-Risk-Management`.

## Treatment planning (lean)

Risk treatment planning is maintained in the **Risk Log** as a treatment view:

- Risk Log (SSOT): `ISMS-Handbook/Registers/07-Risk-Log/Register_Risk-Log.md`

For all risks with Decision = Treat/Avoid/Transfer, the Risk Log MUST capture:
- selected control references (Annex A and/or internal measure IDs),
- up to 1–3 actionable items (tickets/changes) with due dates,
- target residual risk band/score,
- accountable risk owner and approvals.

## Controls selection and SoA maintenance (SSOT)

Control selection MUST be traceable and reflected in the SoA:

- SoA (SSOT for applicability, status, evidence):
  `ISMS-Handbook/Registers/09-Statement-of-Applicability/Register_Statement-of-Applicability.md`

For each selected control, the SoA MUST document:
- applicable (Y/N) with justification,
- implementation status (Implemented/Planned/Not applicable),
- evidence links (policies, configurations, logs, tests, tickets).

## Residual risk acceptance

After treatment actions are implemented, the risk MUST be re-assessed using the same criteria (LRM-44). Residual risk acceptance MUST be documented with the required approval level.
