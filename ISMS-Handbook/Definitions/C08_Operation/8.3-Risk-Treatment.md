# Risk Treatment

## Summary

Identified risks must be treated — whether through avoidance, mitigation, transfer or conscious acceptance. This document describes the treatment options, control planning and effectiveness review of implemented controls. Documented risk treatment closes the loop from assessment to concrete improvement. If identified risks remain untreated, the effectiveness of the ISMS is not given.

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** Identified risks without a traceable treatment decision remain an open security deficit. Whether avoidance, mitigation, transfer or acceptance — each decision must be documented and justified.

Operational risk treatment closes the loop from assessment to concrete improvement. It ensures that risk owners make a conscious and verifiable decision for each identified risk.

The treatment options are normatively defined in CB_POL_L2_11; the workflow is governed by CB_PRC_07. Controls, responsible persons and deadlines are documented in the risk treatment plan (HB_REG_07), results are tracked in the risk register (HB_REG_06).

**Scope:** All identified IS risks requiring treatment. Target audience: Risk owners (implementation), CISO (review), auditors (evidence).

## Implementation

[Organization] implements the IS risk treatment plan (HB_REG_07) as follows:

- **Treatment options:** The four options (avoid, reduce, transfer, accept) are defined in CB_POL_L2_11-Risk-Management. For "Reduce," appropriate security measures are identified by SM-ID lookup in the security measures register (HB_REG_12) or newly created there.
- **Security measures register:** HB_REG_12 is the single source of truth for all security measure details. The treatment plan (HB_REG_07) references measures by SM-ID; it does not duplicate measure descriptions.
- **Gap logic:** When a risk scenario has no matching security measure in HB_REG_12, or when an existing measure only partially addresses the scenario, this constitutes a gap. Gaps are flagged in HB_REG_07 and must be addressed through one of the treatment options. Unaddressed gaps represent residual risks requiring formal acceptance.
- **Control planning:** For each risk, controls, responsible persons and deadlines are established in the risk treatment plan (HB_REG_07).
- **Implementation:** The responsible persons implement controls within the established timeframes.
- **Effectiveness review:** The CISO reviews the effectiveness of implemented controls and updates the risk register (HB_REG_06) with the new risk level (net risk).
- **Annex A reconciliation:** Selected controls are reconciled against the 93 Annex A controls. The SoA (HB_REG_02) is updated as a result of risk treatment (Clause 6.1.3 c, d).
- **Residual risk acceptance:** Top management approves the risk treatment plan and formally accepts residual risks (Clause 6.1.3 f). Accepted risks are documented in the risk register (HB_REG_06) with rationale, approver and reassessment date.
- **Workflow:** The complete workflow is described in CB_PRC_07-Risk-Management (section Risk Treatment).

**Documentation evidence:** HB_REG_07-Risk-Treatment-Plan (controls and implementation status) and HB_REG_06-Risk-Register (risk treatment results).
