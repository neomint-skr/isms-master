# Operational Planning and Control

## Summary

The best policies are useless if their implementation is not planned and controlled. This document describes five control aspects — from establishing criteria to controlling externally provided processes — and maps them to ISMS processes. Operational planning ensures that IS requirements are actually implemented in day-to-day operations. Without control, a gap emerges between documented requirements and actual practice.

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** Policies and risk treatment controls are only effective when their implementation in day-to-day operations is planned and controlled. Without operational control, a gap emerges between documented requirements and actual practice.

The five control aspects ensure that IS criteria are established, implemented, adjusted when changes occur and enforced for externally provided processes. They form the operational bridge between planning (Clause 6) and performance evaluation (Clause 9).

Criteria are anchored in policies (CB_POL_L2_01..L2_11) and process descriptions (CB_PRC_01..PRC_12). Planned changes are managed through CB_PRC_05 (Change Management), externally provided processes through CB_PRC_12 (Supplier Management).

**Scope:** All operational IS processes within the ISMS scope. Target audience: CISO (control), process owners (implementation), auditors (evidence).

## Control Aspects

The organization controls ISMS processes through:

| Aspect | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Establish criteria for processes | Policies (CB_POL_L2_01..L2_11), process descriptions (CB_PRC_01..PRC_12) |
| Implement control in accordance with criteria | Operational execution of documented processes |
| Control planned changes | CB_PRC_05-Change-Management, HB_CLS_6.3 |
| Review unintended changes | CB_PRC_06-Incident-Response, CB_PRC_07-Risk-Management |
| Control externally provided processes | CB_PRC_12-Supplier-Management, CB_POL_L2_06-Suppliers |

Documented information is maintained to the extent necessary to have confidence that processes are being carried out as planned.
