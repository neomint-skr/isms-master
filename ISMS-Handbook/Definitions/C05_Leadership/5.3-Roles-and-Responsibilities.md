# Roles and Responsibilities

## Summary

Clear responsibilities are the prerequisite for reliable execution of ISMS tasks. This document defines the ISMS roles, assigns competence levels and maps accountability for documents and processes through RACI matrices. As the central reference (SSOT), it prevents responsibility gaps and duplication of effort. Unclear responsibilities cause critical tasks to remain unaddressed — a systematic risk for the entire ISMS.

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** Without clearly defined responsibilities, ISMS tasks are either neglected or duplicated — both undermine the effectiveness of information security management. Responsibility gaps are a frequent audit finding and a systematic risk for the ISMS.

This document defines the ISMS roles (CISO, IS-Coordinator, CEO, CTO), assigns competence levels and maps accountability for documents and processes through RACI matrices. As the SSOT for all ISMS responsibilities, it prevents duplication and ensures traceability.

The role profiles and document RACI form the basis for review and approval processes (CB_POL_L2_08). The process RACI assigns each ISMS activity to an accountable role and is complemented by process-specific roles (risk owner, asset owner, reporter).

**Scope:** All ISMS activities: document creation, review, approval, register maintenance, risk management and audits. Target audience: All ISMS role holders, auditors.

## ISMS Roles

| Role | Abbreviation | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) | [CISO] | Conception, documentation, advisory, technical review of all ISMS documents |
| IS-Coordinator | [IS-Coordinator] | Operational implementation, register maintenance, approval of operational documents (L3, PRC, REG, CLS) |
| CEO | [CEO] | Strategic approval (L1, L2), management commitment, resource provision |
| CTO | [CTO] | Technical approval (L2), equal ISMS governance with CEO |

## CISO Role Profile

The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) reports directly to executive management and has a direct reporting right (addresses A.5.2). The CISO is not subordinate to the IT department to avoid role conflicts between control and operations.

The CISO's responsibilities include:

- Steering and coordinating the IS process
- Developing and maintaining the security concept
- Initiating and supporting awareness measures
- Investigating security incidents
- Advising executive management and regular reporting
- Technical review of all ISMS documents

[Combined CISO/DPO role — if applicable: document interface definition and resource assurance]

Competence requirements per role are defined in HB_CLS_7.2-Competence (section Role Competence Profiles). The role is formally appointed and demonstrably competent (Clause 7.2 d).

## Segregation of Duties

Conflicting duties and conflicting areas of responsibility are separated to reduce the risk of unauthorized or unintentional modification of assets (addresses A.5.3). Where full separation is not feasible due to organizational size, compensating controls (e.g. four-eyes review, audit trail) are applied. The CISO monitors SoD effectiveness and reports conflicts to top management.

## Responsibility Matrix (RACI)

Responsibilities are assigned via a RACI matrix (addresses A.5.2):

| Abbreviation | Meaning | Description |
|---|---|---|
| R | Responsible | Primary responsibility for task execution |
| A | Accountable | Ultimately answerable (typically budget holder, one person) |
| C | Consulted | Practical role with guidance, consulted before decisions |
| I | Informed | Interest in status, informed about results |

A RACI row is defined for each ISMS activity. The matrix is updated when roles change or new processes are introduced.

| Activity | CISO ([CISO]) | Coordinator ([IS-Coordinator]) | CEO ([CEO]) | CTO ([CTO]) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Create L1/L2 | R | I | — | — |
| Review L1 | R | — | — | — |
| Approve L1 | — | — | A | C |
| Review L2 | R | — | — | — |
| Approve L2 | — | — | A | A |
| Create L3/PRC/REG/CLS | R | C | — | — |
| Review L3/PRC/REG/CLS | R | — | — | — |
| Approve L3/PRC/REG/CLS | — | A | — | — |
| Maintain registers | C | R | — | — |
| Risk assessment | R | C | I | I |
| Internal audits | R | A | I | I |
| Management review | R | C | A | C |

Review and approval criteria as well as the review cycle are defined in CB_POL_L2_08-Document-Control (section Review and Approval).

## Process RACI

Responsibilities per ISMS process. R = Responsible, A = Accountable, C = Consulted, I = Informed.

| Process | CISO ([CISO]) | Coordinator ([IS-Coordinator]) | CEO ([CEO]) | CTO ([CTO]) | Others |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PRC_01 Incident Management | R | C | I | A | Reporter |
| PRC_02 Access Control | C | R | I | A | Requester |
| PRC_03 Backup & Recovery | A | I | I | R | IT/Operations |
| PRC_04 Vulnerability Mgmt | R | I | I | A | IT/Operations |
| PRC_05 Change Management | C | I | I | A | Requester |
| PRC_06 Supplier Management | C | R | A | C | — |
| PRC_07 Risk Management | R | C | A | C | Risk owner |
| PRC_08 Internal Audit | R | A | I | I | — |
| PRC_09 Management Review | R | C | A | C | — |
| PRC_10 Nonconformity Mgmt | R | C | I | I | — |
| PRC_11 Performance Mon. | R | C | I | I | — |
| PRC_12 Asset Management | C | R | I | I | Asset owner |

### Process-Specific Roles

These roles are required in the respective processes and complement the ISMS roles:

| Role | Responsibility | Relevant for |
|---|---|---|
| Asset owner | Domain responsibility for asset content, accuracy and currency | PRC_12 |
| IT / Operations | Domain support for technical changes and dependencies | PRC_03, PRC_04, PRC_12 |
| Reporter | Initial reporting of security incidents | PRC_01 |
| Risk owner | Domain responsibility for identified IS risks; decides treatment option and accepts residual risks | PRC_07 |
| Requester | Initiates access or change requests | PRC_02, PRC_05 |
