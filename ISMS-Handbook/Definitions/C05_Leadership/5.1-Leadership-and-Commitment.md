# Leadership and Commitment

## Summary

Without visible support from top management, any ISMS remains ineffective. This document maps the seven leadership commitments — from policy adoption to resource provision — to the ISMS documents and processes. Demonstrable leadership is a prerequisite for ISMS acceptance within the organization. If top management commitment is lacking, this is assessed as a major nonconformity during audit.

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** Information security cannot be achieved through technical controls alone — it requires decisions on resources, priorities, and strategic direction that only top management can make. Without visible commitment from top management, the ISMS lacks enforcement authority.

The seven leadership commitments ensure that top management actively fulfils its ISMS role — from policy adoption through resource provision to promoting continual improvement. Demonstrating this commitment is a fundamental prerequisite for certification.

Each commitment (Clause 5.1 a-g) is assigned to an implementing document or process — from CB_POL_L1_01 (policy) through HB_CLS_7.1 (resources) to CB_PRC_10 (continual improvement). The management review (CB_PRC_09) serves as the central evidence of an active leadership role.

**Scope:** Top management ([CEO], [CTO]) as responsible parties. Target audience: top management (obligation), auditors (evidence).

## Top Management Commitments

Top management ([CEO], [CTO]) demonstrates leadership and commitment through the following actions (addresses A.5.4):

| # | Commitment (Clause 5.1) | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| a | Policy and IS objectives aligned with strategic direction | CB_POL_L1_01-Policy (principles P1-P6), HB_CLS_6.2 (objectives) |
| b | Integration of IS requirements into business processes | Operational processes CB_PRC_01..12 |
| c | Provision of required resources | HB_CLS_7.1 (resources), annual budget |
| d | Communication of the importance of effective IS | CB_AWR_01 (awareness), HB_CLS_7.4 (communication) |
| e | Ensuring the ISMS achieves its intended outcomes | CB_PRC_11 (KPI monitoring), CB_PRC_09 (management review) |
| f | Directing and supporting persons | CB_POL_L2_10 (personnel), HB_CLS_7.2 (competence) |
| g | Promoting continual improvement | CB_PRC_10 (continual improvement), HB_CLS_10.1 (improvement) |

Evidence of commitment is provided through the IS policy (CB_POL_L1_01), regular management reviews (CB_PRC_09), and documented resource provision.

## Contact with Special Interest Groups

The organization maintains contact with relevant security forums, professional associations, and specialist groups to obtain timely information on threats, vulnerabilities, and best practices (addresses A.5.6). A register of memberships and contact points is maintained and reviewed annually. Participation outcomes are reported to top management as part of the management review (CB_PRC_09).

## Threat Intelligence

The organization collects and analyses threat intelligence to inform risk-based decisions (addresses A.5.7). Intelligence is structured across three tiers:

| Tier | Focus | Sources |
|---|---|---|
| Strategic | Threat landscape, adversary motivations, geopolitical trends | [CERT advisories, e.g. BSI, ENISA], industry reports, government publications |
| Tactical | Attack techniques, indicators of compromise, campaign patterns | [Threat feed provider, e.g. MISP/MITRE ATT&CK], vendor advisories |
| Operational | Real-time alerts, active exploit notifications | [SIEM / security monitoring platform], vulnerability databases (NVD, CVE) |

Threat intelligence is integrated into the risk management process (CB_PRC_07) and the incident management process (CB_PRC_01). Evaluation of intelligence quality and relevance is performed [annually | upon significant threat landscape change].
