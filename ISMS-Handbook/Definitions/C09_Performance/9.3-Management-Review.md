# Management Review

## Summary

The management review is the central governance instrument of top management for the ISMS. This document defines which seven inputs are considered and which decisions are expected as output. The annual review ensures that the ISMS remains suitable, adequate and effective. Without a management review, there is no evidence that leadership exercises its governance role — a critical audit finding.

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** The management review is the central instrument through which top management assesses the suitability, adequacy and effectiveness of the ISMS. Without an annual review, there is no evidence that leadership exercises its governance role — a critical audit finding.

The seven inputs consolidate all relevant information sources — from audit results and measurement data through risk status reports to improvement proposals. The outputs result in concrete decisions on improvement opportunities and any changes required to the ISMS.

Each input (Clause 9.3.2 a-g) is assigned to a supplying ISMS document or process. The operational workflow is defined in CB_PRC_09 (Management Review), documentation is done via CB_TPL_01.

**Scope:** Overall ISMS evaluation (at least annually). Target audience: Top management (execution), CISO (preparation), auditors (evidence).

## Inputs (9.3.2)

The management review considers the following inputs:

| # | Input | Source |
|---|---|---|
| a | Status of actions from previous reviews | CB_PRC_09 (action protocol) |
| b | Changes in external and internal issues | HB_CLS_4.1, HB_REG_09 |
| c | Changes in needs of interested parties | HB_CLS_4.2, HB_REG_08 |
| d | Feedback on IS performance (NC, measurement results, audit results, objective achievement) | HB_CLS_9.1, HB_CLS_9.2, HB_CLS_10.2 |
| e | Feedback from interested parties | HB_CLS_4.2 |
| f | Results of risk assessment and status of risk treatment plan | HB_REG_06, HB_REG_07 |
| g | Opportunities for continual improvement | HB_CLS_10.1 |

The outputs of the management review include decisions on improvement opportunities and any changes to the ISMS that may be needed. Results are documented and used as input for action planning.
