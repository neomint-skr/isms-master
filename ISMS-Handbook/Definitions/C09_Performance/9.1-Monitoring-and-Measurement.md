# Monitoring and Measurement

## Summary

What is not measured cannot be improved. This document defines what is monitored, which methods and timeframes apply and who analyses and evaluates the results. Performance measurement provides objective data for the management review and the identification of improvement potential. Without systematic monitoring, the effectiveness of the ISMS remains an unsubstantiated claim.

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** The effectiveness of controls and ISMS processes cannot be demonstrated without systematic measurement. Without objective data, improvement decisions are based on assumptions rather than facts.

IS performance monitoring provides measurable results on processes, controls and IS objectives and thus creates the basis for the management review and the identification of improvement potential (addresses A.5.36). Comparable methods ensure that trends are recognizable and progress is demonstrable.

The six determinations (Clause 9.1 a-f) are operationalized in CB_PRC_11 (Performance Monitoring) and linked to the IS objectives (HB_CLS_6.2). Measurement results feed as input into the management review (HB_CLS_9.3).

**Scope:** IS processes, controls and IS objectives. Target audience: CISO (analysis), top management (evaluation), auditors (evidence).

## Determinations

The organization determines for IS performance monitoring:

| # | Aspect | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| a | What shall be monitored and measured | IS processes, controls, IS objectives (HB_CLS_6.2) |
| b | Methods for comparable results | CB_PRC_11 (measurement methods and KPI definitions) |
| c | When monitoring and measuring shall be performed | CB_PRC_11 (measurement cycles) |
| d | Who shall monitor and measure | CB_PRC_11 (RACI) |
| e | When results shall be analysed and evaluated | Before management review (CB_PRC_09) |
| f | Who shall analyse and evaluate results | CISO ([CISO]) |

Results are documented and feed as input into the management review (HB_CLS_9.3).
