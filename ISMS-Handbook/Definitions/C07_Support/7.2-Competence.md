# Competence

## Summary

Information security only works when those involved know what they are doing. This document defines three competence levels for IS-relevant activities and maps the four ISO requirements — determine competence, ensure competence, acquire competence, retain evidence — to the responsible functions. Demonstrated competence is a prerequisite for the effectiveness of all ISMS processes. If competence evidence is missing, the auditor can challenge the effectiveness of the entire ISMS.

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** Security technology and processes are only effective when those involved can competently apply them. Missing or undemonstrated IS competence calls the effectiveness of all ISMS processes into question — a frequent audit finding.

The three competence levels and four ISO requirements (determine, ensure, acquire, retain evidence) create a continuous framework from role requirements to documented evidence. They connect role profiles with targeted qualification.

Competence levels are anchored in the role profiles (HB_CLS_5.3), the training programme is governed by CB_POL_L2_10. Competence evidence is retained as documented information and reviewed for adequacy during the management review.

**Scope:** All persons performing IS-relevant activities. Target audience: CISO (competence planning), domain leads (evidence), auditors (review).

## Competence Levels

Three levels are distinguished for assessing IS competence:

| Level | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | Basic knowledge of IS requirements |
| 2 | Good knowledge with understanding of implementation options |
| 3 | In-depth knowledge with practical implementation experience |

The assignment of competence levels to ISMS roles is defined in HB_CLS_5.3-Roles-and-Responsibilities.

## Requirements

The implementation of the four requirements from Clause 7.2 is mapped as follows:

| # | ISO Requirement | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| a | Determine necessary competence | HB_CLS_5.3 (role profiles with competence levels) |
| b | Ensure competence | CB_POL_L2_10 (training programme, qualification records) |
| c | Take actions to acquire competence | CB_POL_L2_10 (training planning, effectiveness evaluation). For technical IS roles, CB_POL_L2_10 requires role-specific training plans that address the competence levels defined above. |
| d | Retain documented evidence | [HR system / personnel file] |

## Role Competence Profiles

The following table defines the SOLL (target) competence levels for the [CISO] role. Profiles for other ISMS roles are documented in HB_REG_11-Competence-Records.

**[CISO] competence requirements:**

| Competence area | SOLL |
|---|---|
| ISMS concepts, planning and control | 3 |
| IS organization | 3 |
| IS risk management | 3 |
| Preparation of management reviews | 3 |
| Continual improvement | 3 |
| IS resource estimation | 2 |
| IS monitoring and reporting | 3 |
| IS auditing principles | 2 |
| Compliance assurance | 2 |

Role definitions (responsibilities, reporting lines) are in HB_CLS_5.3-Roles-and-Responsibilities.

## Competence Records

SOLL/IST competence assessments per role are documented in HB_REG_11-Competence-Records. The register tracks competence gaps and development actions per assessment cycle.
