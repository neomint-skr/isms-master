# Documented Information

## Summary

Documented information is the evidence that the ISMS exists and functions. This document defines which information must be maintained, how it is created and updated and how its availability, integrity and confidentiality are ensured. Complete documentation is a prerequisite for any certification and enables the traceability of decisions. Without controlled documentation, the auditor lacks the evidence — regardless of how well the ISMS actually works.

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** Documented information is the evidence that the ISMS exists and functions. Without controlled documentation, the auditor lacks the evidence — regardless of how well the controls are actually implemented.

The requirements for documented information ensure that ISMS documents are uniformly identified, version-controlled and protected against unauthorized access. They form the basis for traceability, auditability and knowledge retention.

The uniform metadata block (8 mandatory fields) ensures identification and description; operational control (creation, review, approval, versioning, retention) is defined in CB_POL_L2_08 (Document Control). Templates are provided in CB_TPL_02.

**Scope:** All ISMS documents (standard-required and organization-specific). Target audience: ISMS team (creation/maintenance), auditors (evidence).

## 7.5.1 General

The ISMS encompasses the documented information required by ISO 27001 as well as documented information that the organization has determined as being necessary for the effectiveness of the ISMS (addresses A.5.33).

## 7.5.2 Creating and Updating

### a) Identification and Description

Each ISMS document carries a uniform **metadata block** with 8 mandatory fields:

| Field | Fulfilled by | ISO Reference |
|---|---|---|
| Document ID | Unique reference number (path-based) | 7.5.2 a |
| Version | Semver versioning | 7.5.3 e |
| Classification | Confidentiality classification | A.5.12 |
| Author | Document owner (abbreviation) | 7.5.2 a |
| ISO Reference | Assigned clause / Annex A controls | Best practice |
| Last modified | Date of last change (ISO 8601) | 7.5.2 a |
| Approval | Approving person + date | 7.5.2 c |
| Review cycle | Scheduled review interval | A.5.1 |

Copy template: CB_TPL_02-Document-Metadata. Operational rules: CB_POL_L2_08-Document-Control.

## 7.5.3 Control of Documented Information

Documented information is controlled to ensure availability, suitability and appropriate protection. The controls address:

| # | Aspect |
|---|---|
| c | Distribution, access, retrieval and use |
| d | Storage and preservation including legibility |
| e | Control of changes (version control) |
| f | Retention and disposition |

Documented information of external origin is appropriately identified and controlled. Operational procedures are defined in CB_POL_L2_08-Document-Control.

## Documented Information Requirements of the Standard

ISO/IEC 27001:2022 requires documented information at the following points:

| Clause | Subject | Type |
|---|---|---|
| 4.3 | Scope of the ISMS | Available |
| 5.2 e | IS policy | Available |
| 6.1.2 | IS risk assessment process | Retain |
| 6.1.3 | IS risk treatment process (incl. SoA) | Retain |
| 6.2 g | IS objectives | Available + Retain |
| 7.2 d | Competence evidence | Retain |
| 7.5.1 | Required + deemed necessary DI | Encompass |
| 8.1 | Confidence in planned process execution | Available |
| 8.2 | Results of IS risk assessment | Retain |
| 8.3 | Results of IS risk treatment | Retain |
| 9.1 | Monitoring/measurement results | Available |
| 9.2.2 | Audit programme(s) and audit results | Available |
| 9.3.3 | Results of management review | Available |
| 10.2 f-g | NC type, actions, corrective results | Available |

**Type distinction:**
- **Available:** Must be available as documented information (readable, retrievable)
- **Retain:** Must be retained as documented information (evidence for audit)
- **Encompass:** The ISMS must encompass this DI (overarching)
