# Documented Information

## Summary

Documented information is the evidence that the ISMS exists and functions. This document defines which information must be maintained, how it is created and updated and how its availability, integrity and confidentiality are ensured. Controlled documentation is required to demonstrate traceability of decisions and the implementation status of controls.

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** Ensure that all ISMS-relevant documentation is identifiable, current, protected and auditable.

**Scope:** All documented information required by the ISMS.

## Document control (binding)

Document control requirements are defined in:

- `CB_POL_L2_08-Document-Control`

## Minimum documented information (risk management)

The following risk management documents MUST be maintained as documented information:

- Risk assessment criteria (LRM-44): `CB_POL_L2_11-Risk-Management` and `ISMS-Handbook/Registers/05-Risk-Library/`
- Scope unit assessment records: `ISMS-Handbook/Registers/06-Risk-Assessments/Scope-Units/`
- Risk Log (SSOT for risks and treatment view): `ISMS-Handbook/Registers/07-Risk-Log/Register_Risk-Log.md`
- Statement of Applicability (SoA) including evidence: `ISMS-Handbook/Registers/09-Statement-of-Applicability/Register_Statement-of-Applicability.md`

These records ensure traceability from risk scenarios to treatment decisions, selected controls and evidence.

## Access protection and retention

Classification, access rules and retention periods apply as defined in the Document Control Standard and relevant policies.
