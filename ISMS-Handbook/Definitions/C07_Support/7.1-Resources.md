# Resources

## Summary

An ISMS requires personnel, competence, budget and infrastructure — without adequate resources, it remains a paper exercise. This document describes the four resource categories and assigns their governance to the responsible functions. Resource planning ensures that the ISMS can be operated and improved on an ongoing basis. If resources are not systematically planned, the ISMS risks failing due to operational overload.

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** An ISMS without adequate resources — personnel, competence, budget, infrastructure — can neither be operated nor improved on a sustained basis. Missing resource planning causes security tasks to fail due to operational overload.

Systematic resource planning ensures that all means required for ISMS operation are identified, provided and reviewed for adequacy. It connects the leadership commitment to resource provision (HB_CLS_5.1) with operational needs.

The four resource categories (personnel, competence, budget, infrastructure) are assigned to responsible functions and evidence documents. Adequacy is reviewed during the management review (HB_CLS_9.3) and adjusted as needed.

**Scope:** All resources required for the ISMS. Target audience: Top management (provision), CISO (needs assessment), auditors (evidence).

## Resource Provision

Top management determines and provides the resources needed for the establishment, implementation, maintenance and continual improvement of the ISMS (Cl. 7.1). The needs assessment is initiated by the CISO and submitted to top management for approval. Resource adequacy is reviewed at least annually during the management review (HB_CLS_9.3); shortfalls are escalated as improvement actions (HB_CLS_10.1).

## Resource Categories

| Category | Description | Assignment |
|---|---|---|
| Personnel | ISMS roles and their time allocation | HB_CLS_5.3 (role profiles) |
| Competence | Training and qualification | HB_CLS_7.2, CB_POL_L2_10 |
| Budget | [Annual IS budget, approved by top management] | HB_CLS_9.3 (management review) |
| Infrastructure | [Technical tools and systems for ISMS operation] | CB_POL_L2_05 (IT Operations) |

Adequacy of resources is reviewed during the management review (HB_CLS_9.3).
