# Communication

## Summary

Effective information security requires clear communication — internally towards employees and externally towards customers, partners and authorities. This document defines what, when, with whom and how IS-related communication takes place. Structured communication ensures that relevant information reaches the right recipients. Without a communication concept, security requirements remain unknown and incidents are reported late.

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** Security requirements that are not communicated cannot be followed; incidents that are not reported cannot be handled. Missing IS communication interrupts the information flow on which the entire ISMS depends.

The structured communication framework defines what, when, with whom and how IS-related communication takes place — internally and externally. It ensures that relevant information reaches the right recipients in a timely manner.

Communication occasions are assigned to operational documents and processes — from policy communication (CB_POL_L1_01) through training (CB_POL_L2_10) to incident reporting (CB_PRC_06). The management review (CB_PRC_09) serves as the central communication occasion towards top management.

**Scope:** All ISMS-related communication. Target audience: CISO (planning), all communication participants, auditors (evidence).

## Communication Aspects

The organization determines for IS-related communication:

| Aspect | Definition |
|---|---|
| What | IS policy, ISMS changes, security incidents, objective achievement |
| When | Regularly (annual training, management review) and event-driven |
| With whom | Internal: employees, management. External: customers, suppliers, authorities |
| How | Training, team meetings, email briefings, individual discussions |

## Assignment

| Communication occasion | Operationalization |
|---|---|
| IS policy and principles | CB_POL_L1_01, CB_AWR_01 |
| Training and awareness | CB_POL_L2_10, CB_AWR_02 |
| Security incidents | CB_PRC_06-Incident-Response |
| Management review | CB_PRC_09-Management-Review |
| IS objectives and achievement | HB_CLS_6.2, CB_PRC_11-Performance-Monitoring |

## Communication Methods

The organization uses the following communication methods for IS-relevant topics:

| Method | Target audience | Example frequency | Content |
|---|---|---|---|
| Town hall meeting | All employees | Annually | ISMS requirements, impact on business processes |
| Management briefings | Top management | [frequency, e.g. Quarterly] | Priority IS matters, risk status |
| Security training | All employees | Annually + onboarding | Awareness basics, phishing, password hygiene |
| Team meetings | Department teams | Event-driven | Security topics in daily work |
| Briefing emails | Relevant employees | As needed | Changes in ISMS operations, new policies |
| Individual discussion | Affected person | As needed | Clarification, warning, disciplinary actions |

Specific dates are set during the annual ISMS planning cycle.
