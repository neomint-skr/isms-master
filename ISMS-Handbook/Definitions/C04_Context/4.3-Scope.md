# ISMS Scope

## Summary

The scope defines the boundaries of the ISMS — what is protected and what is not. This document describes the organizational, physical, and IT system boundaries as well as justified exclusions. A clearly defined scope is a prerequisite for any certification and focuses resource allocation. An unclear or overly broad scope leads to unrealistic expectations; a scope that is too narrow leaves critical areas unprotected.

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** An ISMS scope that is too broad ties resources to non-critical areas; a scope that is too narrow leaves business-critical information unprotected. Precise delineation determines which organizational units, locations, and systems are protected — and which are not.

The scope definition establishes the organizational, physical, and IT system boundaries of the ISMS in a binding manner and identifies justified exclusions. It is a prerequisite for any certification and focuses resource allocation on areas that genuinely require protection.

The scope is established based on the organizational context (HB_CLS_4.1) and stakeholder requirements (HB_CLS_4.2). Control applicability within the scope is documented in the SoA (HB_REG_02).

**Scope:** Entire organization and all ISMS-relevant locations, systems, and service providers. Target audience: top management (determination), auditors (evidence).

## Scope Dimensions

The ISMS scope is established along four dimensions: organizational boundaries, physical boundaries, IT system boundaries, and exclusions. Each dimension describes an independent aspect of delineation. The scope considers external and internal issues (Clause 4.1), requirements of interested parties (Clause 4.2), and interfaces and dependencies to activities of other organizations.

## Organizational Boundaries

The organizational baseline data (legal form, organizational units, locations, employees, key partners) is documented in the Context Register (HB_REG_09) as SSOT. The ISMS scope encompasses all organizational units recorded there.

| Area | Source | In scope | Remarks |
|---|---|---|---|
| All organizational units | HB_REG_09 | Yes | — |
| All locations incl. remote | HB_REG_09 | Yes | — |
| Outsourced functions | HB_REG_09 + HB_REG_04 | Yes (via supplier management) | — |

## Physical Boundaries

Location data is recorded in HB_REG_09 (organizational profile). Physical areas relevant to the ISMS scope:

| Area | In scope | Remarks |
|---|---|---|
| Office location(s) | Yes | [Address] |
| Remote workplaces | Yes | Governed by CB_POL_L2_10, CB_POL_L3_01 |

## IT System Boundaries

All internally and externally hosted information systems within the scope are recorded. Individual systems are documented in the Asset Register (HB_REG_03).

| Category | Examples |
|---|---|
| Production systems | [Core application, e.g. SaaS platform] |
| Cloud services | [Provider and services, e.g. AWS, Microsoft 365] |
| Development environment | [Tools and platforms, e.g. GitHub, CI/CD] |
| Supporting systems | [e.g. email, accounting, HR system] |

## Exclusions

Exclusions from the ISMS scope are documented and justified. They must be compatible with the overall security concept and must not impair the organization's ability to achieve its IS objectives.

[Exclusions with justification, e.g. "No physical manufacturing — purely digital business model"]

## Scope Statement

[Organization] operates an ISMS covering all information, information processing facilities, and business processes. The scope encompasses the defined locations as well as activities performed by service providers.
