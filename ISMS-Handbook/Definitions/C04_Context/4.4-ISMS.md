# Information Security Management System

## Summary

The ISMS is not a single document but an interplay of guidelines, processes, and registers. This document maps the twelve ISMS components to the document structure and illustrates their interactions. It serves as a map of the ISMS and ensures the completeness of the system. Without this holistic view, gaps in process coverage may only become apparent during an audit.

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** An ISMS consists of many individual components — guidelines, policies, processes, registers, controls. Without a holistic view of how these components interact, gaps in process coverage may only become apparent during an audit.

The ISMS mapping assigns all twelve components to the document structure and illustrates their interactions. It serves as a map for orientation and completeness verification.

From context and leadership through policies and operational processes to registers and Annex A controls — every component is assigned to a specific document area. Interactions are documented through cross-references in the CLS and PRC documents.

**Scope:** The entire ISMS with all documents and processes. Target audience: ISMS team (orientation), auditors (completeness verification).

## ISMS Components

The ISMS comprises the following components:

| Component | Documentation |
|---|---|
| Context and scope | HB_CLS_4.1 through HB_CLS_4.3 |
| Leadership and commitment | HB_CLS_5.1 through HB_CLS_5.3 |
| IS policy | CB_POL_L1_01-Policy |
| Standards and handbooks | CB_POL_L2_01 through L2_12, CB_POL_L3 |
| Risk assessment and treatment | HB_CLS_6.1, HB_CLS_8.2, HB_CLS_8.3 |
| IS objectives and planning | HB_CLS_6.2, HB_CLS_6.3 |
| Support (resources, competence, awareness) | HB_CLS_7.1 through HB_CLS_7.5 |
| Operational processes | CB_PRC_01 through CB_PRC_12 |
| Performance evaluation | HB_CLS_9.1 through HB_CLS_9.3 |
| Improvement | HB_CLS_10.1, HB_CLS_10.2 |
| Registers (results documentation) | HB_REG_CTX through HB_REG_NC |
| Annex A controls | HB_REG_SOA (SoA) |

Interactions between processes are documented through cross-references in the individual CLS and PRC documents.

## ISMS Core Processes

The organization applies the PDCA cycle (Plan-Do-Check-Act) to all ISMS processes. The four phases form a continual improvement loop:

| Phase | Description | ISMS reference |
|---|---|---|
| Plan | Establish or adjust objectives and processes for IS | Define policies, procedures, controls for risk treatment |
| Do | Implement planned controls | Implement training, security controls, monitoring procedures |
| Check | Monitor and evaluate effectiveness | Conduct audits, reviews, analysis of incidents |
| Act | Improve based on results | Update policies, implement additional controls, conduct training |

This cycle is evident across all ISMS processes (Clauses 4-10) and is explicitly governed through management review (Clause 9.3) and continual improvement (Clause 10.1).
