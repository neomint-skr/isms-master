# Nonconformity and Corrective Action

## Summary

No ISMS is flawless — what matters is the systematic handling of deviations. This document defines what constitutes a nonconformity, from which sources deviations are detected and which six steps are followed from immediate action through to ISMS modification. A functioning NC procedure turns errors into improvement impulses and is therefore a core element of continual improvement. Without systematic NC treatment, root causes remain undetected and recur — a frequent reason for audit findings.

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** No ISMS is flawless — what matters is the systematic handling of deviations. Without traceable NC treatment, root causes remain undetected and recur — a frequent reason for audit findings.

The six treatment steps (from immediate action through to ISMS modification) ensure that each nonconformity is not only remedied but analysed in its root cause and used as an improvement impulse. This makes the NC procedure a core element of continual improvement.

The operational workflow is defined in CB_PRC_10 (Nonconformity Management), results are documented in HB_REG_NC (NC Register). Inputs come from internal audits (HB_CLS_9.2), management reviews (HB_CLS_9.3) and performance monitoring (HB_CLS_9.1).

**Scope:** All ISMS nonconformities. Target audience: CISO (coordination), affected role holders (implementation), auditors (evidence).

## Definition

A nonconformity exists when the ISMS fails to meet legal, regulatory or contractual IS requirements.

## Identification

Nonconformities are detected through:

- Internal audits (HB_CLS_9.2, CB_PRC_08)
- External audits ([certification audit / customer audit])
- Management reviews (HB_CLS_9.3, CB_PRC_09)
- Performance monitoring (HB_CLS_9.1, CB_PRC_11)
- Reports from employees

## Severity Classification

Each nonconformity is classified into one of four severity levels upon identification. The classification determines treatment priority and escalation path.

| Level | Abbreviation | Definition | Escalation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Major nonconformity | MaNC | Systemic failure of a requirement; certification at risk | Immediate escalation to top management |
| Minor nonconformity | MiNC | Isolated deviation from a requirement | CISO coordinates corrective action |
| Observation | OBS | Control exists but effectiveness is not fully demonstrated | Tracked in NC register for next review cycle |
| Opportunity for improvement | OFI | No deviation; potential for enhancement identified | Recorded in improvement roadmap (HB_MGT_01) |

## Treatment Steps

| # | Step | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Immediate action | Remedy the problem, prevent aggravation, document |
| 2 | Root cause analysis | Analyse the root cause, document results |
| 3 | Impact assessment | Check for similar existing or potential NCs |
| 4 | Corrective action | Actions with implementation plan and assigned resources |
| 5 | Effectiveness review | Evaluation within an appropriate timeframe; if ineffective, escalation to management review (HB_CLS_9.3) |
| 6 | ISMS modification | If NC is attributable to a system defect — revise the ISMS |

Documented information is retained as evidence of the nature of the NC, actions taken and corrective action results (HB_REG_NC).
