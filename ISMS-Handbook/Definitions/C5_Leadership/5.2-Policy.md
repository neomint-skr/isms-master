# Information Security Policy

## Summary

The IS policy is the strategic foundation of the ISMS and an expression of top management commitment. This document defines the seven requirements for the policy — from fitness for purpose to communication — and demonstrates their fulfilment. The policy anchors information security as an organizational objective and forms the basis for all downstream standards. Without a valid, communicated policy, the ISMS lacks strategic legitimacy.

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** Without a policy adopted by top management, the ISMS lacks strategic legitimacy. The policy articulates the organization's intent to establish information security as a business objective and forms the basis for all downstream standards.

The seven requirements for the IS policy ensure that it is fit for purpose, binding, current, and accessible to all parties involved. It anchors the commitment to IS objectives, compliance, and continual improvement.

The operational implementation of the requirements is carried out in CB_POL_L1_01 (principles P1-P6), supplemented by the communication plan (HB_CLS_7.4) and document control (CB_POL_L2_08). The annual adequacy review is integrated into the management review (CB_PRC_09).

**Scope:** IS policy as a central document. Target audience: top management (adoption), ISMS team (implementation), auditors (evidence).

## Requirements for the IS Policy

| # | Requirement (Clause 5.2) | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| a | Appropriate to the purpose of the organization | CB_POL_L1_01: Principles P1-P6 derived from organizational context (HB_CLS_4.1) |
| b | Include IS objectives or provide framework | CB_POL_L1_01: Principles provide framework; specific objectives in HB_CLS_6.2 |
| c | Commitment to fulfilling applicable requirements | CB_POL_L1_01: Principle P2 (compliance) |
| d | Commitment to continual improvement | CB_POL_L1_01: Principle P5 (continual improvement) |
| e | Available as documented information | CB_POL_L1_01 versioned and controlled (CB_POL_L2_08) |
| f | Communicated within the organization | CB_AWR_02 (onboarding), HB_CLS_7.4 (communication plan) |
| g | Available to interested parties as appropriate | CB_POL_L1_01 classified as Internal (not Confidential) |

The IS policy is reviewed for adequacy at least annually as part of the management review (CB_PRC_09).
