# Risks and Opportunities

## Summary

Risk management is the core of every ISMS — without systematic risk assessment, there is no basis for effective controls. This document establishes the risk assessment process, defines evaluation criteria and describes risk treatment including the selection of Annex A controls. The results steer resource allocation and prioritization of security controls. Without traceable risk assessment, the adequacy of the entire ISMS cannot be demonstrated.

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** Effective controls require IS risks to be systematically identified, evaluated and treated. Without this framework, there is no traceable basis for the selection and prioritization of Annex A controls.

The risk assessment and risk treatment framework forms the core of the ISMS and drives targeted resource allocation. It connects the organizational context (HB_CLS_4.1/4.2) through risk analysis with concrete controls and the Statement of Applicability.

The evaluation criteria are normatively defined in CB_POL_L2_11; the operational workflow follows CB_PRC_07. Risk entries are documented in HB_REG_06, controls in HB_REG_07, and control applicability in HB_REG_02 (SoA).

**Scope:** All IS-relevant risks and opportunities within the ISMS scope. Target audience: CISO (coordination), risk owners (evaluation), auditors (evidence).

## 6.1.1 General

[Organization] considers the organizational context (HB_CLS_4.1) and the requirements of interested parties (HB_CLS_4.2) during ISMS planning. Risks and opportunities derived from these are addressed through the risk management process (CB_PRC_07). Integration into ISMS processes and effectiveness evaluation are carried out through performance monitoring (CB_PRC_11) and management review (CB_PRC_09).

## 6.1.2 Risk Assessment

[Organization] has defined and applied an IS risk assessment process:

- **Risk criteria** (6.1.2 a): Likelihood, impact, acceptance criteria and risk matrix are mandated in CB_POL_L2_11-Risk-Management.
- **Protection requirements** (6.1.2 a): The risk assessment is preceded by a protection requirements analysis per asset and core value (C/I/A). The maximum principle and inheritance along dependency chains are defined in CB_POL_L2_11-Risk-Management (section Protection Requirements Analysis).
- **Consistency** (6.1.2 b): The process (CB_PRC_07) ensures that repeated assessments produce consistent and comparable results.
- **Identification, analysis, evaluation** (6.1.2 c-e): The operational workflow is described in CB_PRC_07 (section Risk Assessment). Results are documented in the risk register (HB_REG_06).
- **Catalog-based risk identification** (6.1.2 c): Risk identification follows a structured, catalog-based approach. Threat catalogues, vulnerability catalogues and a vulnerability assessment with defined status logic (present/not present/unknown/not applicable) provide the systematic basis. Risk scenarios are generated automatically from threat-vulnerability pairs under aspect-tag compatibility. The methodology is normatively defined in CB_POL_L2_11-Risk-Management (sections Risk Identification Methodology and Scenario Generation Rules).

**Documentation evidence:** CB_PRC_07-Risk-Management (process description) and HB_REG_06-Risk-Register (results).

## 6.1.3 Risk Treatment

[Organization] has defined and applied an IS risk treatment process:

- **Treatment options** (6.1.3 a): Four options are defined in CB_POL_L2_11-Risk-Management.
- **Determine controls** (6.1.3 b): Necessary controls are identified in the process (CB_PRC_07, section Determine Controls). The security measures register (HB_REG_12) serves as the single source of truth for all security measure details; the treatment plan (HB_REG_07) references measures by SM-ID.
- **Annex A comparison** (6.1.3 c): The comparison is performed in the process (CB_PRC_07) to ensure no relevant controls are overlooked.
- **Statement of Applicability** (6.1.3 d): The SoA (HB_REG_02) documents all 93 Annex A controls with justification for inclusion or exclusion and implementation status.
- **Risk treatment plan** (6.1.3 e): HB_REG_07-Risk-Treatment-Plan documents controls, responsible persons and deadlines.
- **Approval** (6.1.3 f): Described in the process (CB_PRC_07, section Approval).

**Documentation evidence:** CB_PRC_07-Risk-Management, HB_REG_07-Risk-Treatment-Plan and HB_REG_02-Statement-of-Applicability.
