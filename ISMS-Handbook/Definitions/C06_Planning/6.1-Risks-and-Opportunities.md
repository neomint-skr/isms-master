# Risks and Opportunities

## Summary

Risk management is the core of the ISMS. This document explains how information security risks and opportunities are addressed through binding criteria (LRM-44), an operational process, and traceable documented information (Risk Log and SoA). The purpose is to ensure consistent decisions, demonstrable adequacy of controls, and management visibility.

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** Establish a consistent and traceable approach to risk assessment and treatment, aligned with Clause 6.1.

**Scope:** All information security risks and opportunities within the ISMS scope.

## Binding references (SSOT)

- **Risk Management Standard (criteria):** `CB_POL_L2_11-Risk-Management`
- **Risk Management Process (workflow):** `CB_PRC_07-Risk-Management`
- **Risk Library (matrix, rubrics, scenario library):** `ISMS-Handbook/Registers/05-Risk-Library/`
- **Risk Log (risk decisions and treatment view):** `ISMS-Handbook/Registers/07-Risk-Log/Register_Risk-Log.md`
- **SoA (controls applicability, status, evidence):** `ISMS-Handbook/Registers/09-Statement-of-Applicability/Register_Statement-of-Applicability.md`

## Risk assessment criteria

[Organization] SHALL define and maintain:

- Impact and likelihood scales (4×4)
- Risk scoring and bands
- Risk acceptance criteria and approval levels
- Binding rubrics for impact and likelihood

All criteria are maintained in the Risk Management Standard and the Risk Library.

## Risk treatment and control selection

For risks above acceptance criteria, [Organization] SHALL:

- choose a treatment option (avoid, mitigate, transfer, accept),
- select controls (Annex A and/or internal measures),
- maintain a Statement of Applicability (SoA) documenting applicability, justification and implementation status,
- obtain residual risk acceptance at the defined approval level.

## Documented information (evidence)

The following documented information MUST exist and be maintained:

- Risk Log (risk scenarios, scoring, decisions, approvals, treatment actions)
- Scope unit assessment records (supporting workshop evidence)
- SoA (controls and evidence)

These records provide traceability from risk scenario → decision → controls → evidence.
