# Planning of Changes

## Summary

Changes to the ISMS — whether driven by new requirements, reorganization or technology shifts — must be planned to preserve the integrity of the system. This document defines five planning aspects and identifies typical triggers for ISMS changes. Structured change planning prevents modifications from causing unintended side effects. Unplanned changes can render existing controls ineffective and introduce new risks.

## Objective and Scope

**Objective:** Changes to the ISMS — whether driven by new requirements, reorganization or technology shifts — can render existing controls ineffective or introduce new risks. Unplanned changes jeopardize the integrity of the overall system.

Structured change planning ensures that each modification is evaluated regarding purpose, consequences, integrity, resources and responsibilities. It prevents unintended side effects and maintains system consistency.

Typical triggers (management review, audits, risk assessments) are identified through the respective processes (CB_PRC_09, CB_PRC_08, CB_PRC_07). The operational management of changes is handled through CB_PRC_05 (Change Management).

**Scope:** All structural or substantive changes to the ISMS. Target audience: CISO (planning), top management (approval), auditors (evidence).

## Planning Aspects

When the organization determines changes to the ISMS, the following aspects are evaluated:

| Aspect | Guiding question |
|---|---|
| Purpose | Why is the change necessary? |
| Consequences | What are the consequences of the change for the ISMS? |
| ISMS integrity | How is it ensured that the ISMS remains effective? |
| Resources | What resources are required? |
| Responsibilities | Who is responsible for planning and implementation? |

## Change Triggers

Changes to the ISMS may be triggered by:

- Results of the management review (CB_PRC_09)
- Internal and external audit results (CB_PRC_08)
- Risk assessments (CB_PRC_07)
- Nonconformities and corrective actions (CB_PRC_10)
- Changes in the organizational context (HB_CLS_4.1)
